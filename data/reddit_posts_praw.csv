Business account and GST,0,"I've been self employed with a business number for a number of years, and paid tax with business income via simpletax (wealthsimple now). In 2022 I became salaried elsewhere and ramped down my personal business, in preparation of cutting it off entirely in 2023 (0). 
I filed my tax at the beginning of this year for both the employment income and business income via wealthsimple and paid the amount owed. 

However, I just got a notice of reassessment for the business accounts GST/HST saying it had not been paid, and after logging in to the cra had mails that were not going to my email. 

Bit confused as I've never had this problem in the past.  
Am I to pay GST/HST returns, since both my incomes were reported on the tax forms that I paid via my bank for it all? 

tldr;

- used to be 100% self employed, had bn, filed via wealthsimple and paid via my bank with no issue

- was split in 2022, filed employment income and business income via wealthsimple and paid via my bank

- got messages in my cra business account (not personal) about gst/hst returns that were equal to the amount I paid, got dinged for not paying it

Help! Canadian Resident (Dual CAN-US Citizen) Tax Complications of owning a C-Corp in the US.,0,"Hello Reddit!

We’ve been hard-pressed to find a clear answer to our tax question. I’m hoping some kind internet stranger may have some thoughts.

**Here are the facts about the company:**  
\- US C-Corp  
\- 50/50 ownership with myself and business partner  
\- US C-Corp is located in Seattle, WA  
\- All revenue generated is on the US side

**Here are the facts about me:**  
\- I am a dual citizen of Canada and the USA  
\- I am currently residing in Canada  
\- I file Canadian & US Taxes

We’re aiming to figure out what the most tax efficient way is to draw from our company in 2024. We have time to make adjustments at the company level if need be.

**After some digging, we’ve come up with two trains of thought:**

**1) Transition the company into an S-Corp,** which as a US Citizen I can formally own. This would allow my to take income as an owners draw/Schedule-K on the US side and file a T5013 on the Canadian side. What are the things we need to be aware of here? How would this complicate tax filings? This seems favourable as we should be able to take home more and avoid double taxation / payroll taxes.

**2) Remain as a C-Corp** and set up payroll that operated in US and CAN (ie. Rippling, which would set up an EOR on our behalf in Canada), income would then be added to 10400 T4 slip. No revenue is generated from my nexus in Canada, only work is being preformed. What are the things we need to be aware of here? What filing complications may arise?

DTC Application Timeline,1,"Apologies if this is a silly question, this is my first application of sorts with the CRA and I’m not sure what I’m meant to expect. 

Applied for DTC starting May, originally had a target completion date for Aug 1st. I checked the CRA site and according to the progress tracker, the first time there was an update to the file was Aug 1st and the status change was to ‘In Progress’. 

I called on after realizing I hadn’t heard back and was told the processing time was extended from 8 to 10 weeks.

The 10th week mark came and went so I checked in and they told me someone might have worked on it but it had passed the new processing time and they had to submit a request to review the file which would take 4 weeks. This is the new window I’m in. 

My doctor hasn’t received any correspondence from the CRA, I haven’t received any letters about clarification and strangely enough I can’t download or view the completed application. 

I’m wondering if this is an indication of a file soon to be denied or if anyone has had a similar experience or can share how their experience went?

Recovering 3rd country dividend withholding tax on US-listed ETFs,0,"In my non-registered account, I hold some US-domiciled ETFs of international stocks. The US withholding tax on dividends paid to my brokerage is recoverable at tax time (call this ""Level 2 tax""). However, the withholding tax imposed by 3rd countries on dividends paid to the US ETF provider (call this ""Level 1 tax"") is generally talked about online as not recoverable, or ""probably"" not recoverable.  


**Question 1:** Is there any authoritative source (tax folio, tax court case, etc.) for this assertion?  


**Question 2:** Call me dumb, but I'm inclined to try reporting the Level 1 tax as a foreign tax credit (I think in form T2209) and seeing what happens. What is the worst case scenario? I view this as a good faith effort to recover tax that was actually paid on my behalf, not something nefarious of course.  


**Question 3:** I recognize that calculating the exact amount might be a challenge, as tax systems differ and I don't receive a 1099. I would think I could back out a reasonable estimate from annual reports. For example, per [https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/a ... -08-31.pdf](https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/annual-report/ar-ishares-msci-bic-and-emerging-markets-etfs-08-31.pdf), IEMG (an emerging markets ETF) indicates in various sections:

* Foreign taxes withheld: (254,383,305)
* Foreign withholding tax claims: 4,046,809
* Distributions to shareholders \[I suppose this is total dividends paid out?\]: (2,536,239,296)

Then can I estimate level 1 tax paid, as as a percentage of dividends paid out to unit-holders, as (254,383,305 - 4,046,809) / 2,536,239,296 = 9.87%. I could then claim a foreign tax credit = 9.87% \* (Dividends actually received in my brokerage, grossed up by 15% to account for level 2 tax). This may not be perfect (as you can tell, I'm not an accountant), but seems like a reasonable estimate.

Canadian GAAR Legislation per August 4th Discussion,4,"Hey all,

I've been a reader of this group for a little bit, and am currently an undergraduate student pursuing my BCom in Accounting. I've done two co-op terms in Tax Services, so most of my job was purely compliance. Earlier on in my terms I did prepare a decent amount of instruction letters for various tax planning strategies (something like estate freezes, and surplus-strip transactions). Just wanted to add a little bit of background, as I am quite novice. I've found this subreddit to have some very intelligent people, and am interested in your understanding of the new legislation tabled in Budget 2023 around the GAAR legislation.

My understanding of the case law now, is that GAAR is not supersede specifics within the Act, but to capture the intent of parliament when they wrote the legislation. In Dean's Knight, there was a series of transactions set in place to move around de jure control so they could retain certain losses within the group, these agreed to the specifics of the Act, so instead SCC applied GAAR in this circumstance as GAAR's intent was to capture an aggressive strategy like this. Next, with the amendments applied, the CRA's scope would then significantly increase as it's no longer the *primary purpose* in the series of transactions to obtain a tax benefit or certain tax attributes (like CDA), but merely *one of the purposes.* Additionally, there are the imposed penalties on getting hit with GAAR, as opposed to just reversing to what the transaction would have been without planning. Though it is my understanding there will be a voluntary disclosure to the GAAR, which would void these penalties. And finally, with the comments on August 4th publication, the addition of an economic substance test would essentially render a surplus-strip transaction completely in-effective and as such be caught by the GAAR?

I appreciate your thoughts on this, and please let me know if I \[am\] horribly misunderstanding certain parts :)

Is there any way around the 10 year Legislative restriction on fixing errors/incorrect payments? The CRA Owes *me* Money,0,"This is going to be a little long. But I hope I can cover all the relevant points and make it digestible.

An error was made when my former partner and I split up in 2010. They claimed that they'd always been responsible for caring for our child and CRA clawed back the roughly 11K they'd paid out in CCTB (Now called the CCB) payments.

I have tried various times to correct the issue. I hit many walls, quit and then would try again. I have known since I was young that I had ADHD, I've recently learned I'm on the autism spectrum. These challenges make dealing with an agency like CRA very VERY difficult. Which is why I'd throw my hands up.

Over the years CRA has taken about 5K from my tax returns. So I now owe about 6K

Most recently in March of this year. The answer I received was that there is a ten year limit to resolve such matters. That would be from the initial date of application for the CCTB. Which was 2006. So to correct this I would have had to made an application in 2006.

I also reached out to my MP's office they tried through their contacts within CRA. Again they say there is nothing they can do.

Here are the relevant facts.

1, That money WAS paid to me legitimately. I was entitled to it on behalf of my kid.

2, An error was made without any ill-intent.

3, I, a person w/autism and ADHD have tried on several occasions to resolve this and I've hit barriers every single time.4, My autism/ADHD have also been a barrier to long-term meaningful employment. I've never held a job for much more than a year.

5, This debt is basically a penalty for a disability.

The question is now, what, if anything can I do? Here are some of my thoughts.

A, I've had it suggested that I try to appeal. (Formal Dispute) I am curious anyone has ever tried something like this and had any luck. The only value in this is if they can override that 10 year rule.

B, Is there any kind of compassion exception. Where they can look at my returns, the situation and at least erase the amount I currently owe?

C, Raise a stink. Talk to the media. Not AT ALL something I'd want to do. (Edited to add, and probably not at all a valuable strategy. But, sometimes public pressure does get a result. I doubt it would in this instance and, frankly not something I'd want to go on about.)

Identical security question ETF vs actual,2,"Identical security definition

Hi there. 

I am want to sell my Bitcoin that I hold in my own custody and rebuy in my registered TFSA (I am in Canada) in a Bitcoin ETF. Canada has Bitcoin ETF’s that I can hold in my retirement accounts. 

I want to sell it and buy it immediately in my TFSA as I don’t want to miss potential upside. 

I don’t want to break any tax rules, I am potentially in a small profit now although last year I claimed significant capital losses on the sale of some other amount of Bitcoin. 

Would I allowed to offset my capital gains from my capital losses even though I would rebuy it immediately?

My understanding is that the ETF and the Bitcoin itself are not identical products and therefore wouldn’t apply to the 30 day wash sale rules?

And if so, how do you calculate my income for 2023 when the year is not even close to finished? Is there a form for partial income? If I pay under the amount and in the end made more,  are the penalties high?

I have since looked it up here ([https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/496655/canada1978-dta2014-consol\_-\_in\_force.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/496655/canada1978-dta2014-consol_-_in_force.pdf)) and it looks like the relevant Article is #20:

""20(1). Income received from an estate or trust resident in Canada by a resident of the United Kingdom who is the beneficial owner thereof may be taxed in Canada according to its law, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the income.""

I can't figure out if this means that I really owe 15%, or if the ""according to its law"" bit means that I'll be able to file a Canadian tax return and get the money back (because ""the law"" is ""no inheritance tax""). Does anyone have a source on this? All leads appreciated. Thanks.",2023-08-23 13:46:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/15z4fc0/taxation_of_a_canadian_estate_left_to_a_uk_tax/

I'm still wondering about my last tax return and OAS (Old Age Security),0,"Sorry for this ""passe"" and possibly trivial subject. But I still don't get How and Why the CRA would take it upon themselves to change my tax return without my knowledge or permission. Luckily I saw their alteration and had it changed back. All this happened electronically without paper.

It's common knowledge that if you delay receiving OAS payments until you're older than 65, you will receive slightly increased payments. I have therefore *not* applied for, nor ever received OAS. After I submitted my 2022 return electronically, I went online to check if my return had been received. It all looked fine except for one line (possibly line 11300). There was now an entry of $1 on this line, indicating that I had received a one dollar OAS payment. 

What would have happened had I not corrected their weird entry. I suppose it would mean that when I apply in the future, they might say I don't qualify for increased payments since I'd already started getting it earlier??? I just don't get it. Why would they change my return anyway - what am I missing?",2023-08-21 23:41:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/15xoab3/im_still_wondering_about_my_last_tax_return_and/

What I need to understand is…could I be in trouble because I did not file in my leaving year? Can anyone provide me an advice? Should I just go ahead and file for 2021 using an online tax software to let the CRA know that I left? Is there something I am missing?

Paying corporate tax with negative retained earnings? (T2),2," I am studying to become a CPA and have recently taken more interest in my father's trucking company and its financials. I was reviewing the past years T2's on the My Business CRA account. The retained earnings have been negative in every single year but we still pay income tax every single year. The line 9990 Current Income Taxes always has a round number. For example this year it was 4,275 and last year it was 1,300. There was a net income of around $25k this year but the retained earnings has always been around -50k. In all my classes I have never read about this, if RE is negative, there should be no tax right? Our accountant for 20 years is a CPA with a mid size firm, so he definitely knows what he's doing but I'm really confused. Would love some opinions before I email him, don't want to sound like an idiot lol.

Need help with some financial planning for my older FIL,1,"My FIL wants my help. He has more money than he needs and wants to get it to his grandchildren in the most tax-efficient way possible. The grandchildren are a mix of adult grandkids and young teen grandkids.

He has a defined benefit pension that more than covers his living expenses.

What is the most tax-advantaged way for him to use this money? My first thought is that he should probably give any excess cash to the family members with unused RRSP/TFSA limits and let them top up those accounts, but having only recently moves to Canada myself, I am overwhelmed trying to interpret all the available tax-advantaged plans and programs or even understand how most of them work.

I could probably spend some time reading and figuring out the programs and come up with a plan, but I am concerned about the time it takes to do that. He's had a recent health scare and, quite frankly, I don't want to take too long to figure it out, you know?

400k/yr. Do I need a Holding Company for tax purposes?,0,"Making 400k/yr. Do I need a holding company?

Hi guys, looking for advice. Currently running a business generating ~500k/year in profit. I started in February and have made about 200k so far.

Unfortunately I’ve been too invested in the day-to-day activities of the business and I haven’t set up a corporation yet. I met with a cpa and he had the following recommendations:

1. Set up a HoldCo first 
2. Have the holding company set up an OpCo for the day to day activities, then dividend excess cash into the holdco

Total cost for setting up both the holdco and opco with the accountant, with additional tax planning, was quoted at 4-6K for startup costs. And ~5k in filings at the end of every year

My question is: is the holdco necessary? Or can I get by with just a corporation? The main benefit he was talking about, was deferring legal liability in the case my corporation gets sued or if something happens. 

I’m not sure of the longevity of this business but I’m assuming ill be able to sustain this level of income for ~2 years. Additionally, I have no plans of selling the company. 

Additionally, other short term goals for me (within the next 4 years) are owning a property or two.",2023-08-20 22:05:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/15woj73/400kyr_do_i_need_a_holding_company_for_tax/

I have an incorporated opco and want a holding company for creditor protection but also want to be able to sell in a few decades’ time and use the capital gains exemption. The problem is if the holdco owns 100% of the opco, I can’t use the CGE (the holdco will have way more passive assets than the opco is worth, so I won’t pass the 50% test, at least). 

Will this work:
1) I individually own 99% of opco
2) Holdco owns a different class of shares worth 1% of opco
3) Opco can dividend all the cash to holdco to protect the assets. No tax since they’re connected (I control holdco and opco)

for the cash 50% portion -> you pay capital gains tax on any gain relative to your cost basis versus the cash received.

for the stock 50% portion -> the fmv value of the shares received (avgo) minus the cost basis of the VMW shares using the ratio of the conversion = unrealized gain until the successor stock is sold in open market.

Tax implications for primary residence used for rental,1,"Hi Cantax

I recently started working and looking to buy a place in the Greater Vancouver area. Fortunately, I still the option of living with my folks and was thinking about getting my first home and renting it out to build equity and save money for a larger down payment for a larger home in the future.

My main question would be what the tax implications are for the capital gain of the property and the principal residence exemption. From what I understand, you may not live in your principle residence and rent it out for up to 4 years while maintaining the principle residence status through a special tax election. Since this would be my first home, let's say I buy it and declare it as my principle residence and decide to rent it out. Since it is still my principle residence, there would not be a deemed deposition and thus I could avoid paying any capital gain. I would of course report rental income.

Now if I fast-forward 4 years and decide to move back in (although I'm not sure if this is tax-years or 4 years from starting the rental), is it correct that I can move back into my residence and have no tax consequences as a result?

Another scenario is if I rent it out for 6 years, at the 4 year mark would the property be deemed to not be my principle residence anymore and a deemed deposition at FMV occurs? Then at the 6 year mark I move back in and then another deemed deposition occurs. If I then sold my property at 8 years, would I have to pay the capital gain only for the period between years 4-6?

Is this how it works and are there any other tax implications or savings that I can get if I choose to execute this? (For example, could I move back in after 4 years for a short duration to reset the 4 year limit and then rent it out again)

Back dating non resident.,1,"I have a few questions regarding filing as a non-resident. Some background I left Canada in 2015 and have not lived nor worked (made any type of income in Canada since). I was very young when I left I did not do my due diligence when leaving, and want to clear everything up. My questions are:

Can I backdate the non-resident of Canada? I have not worked in Canada since 2015, nor do I own any property, etc. I never filled one out. I have proof that I have lived abroad since. 

If I earn income and it's paid via Paypal or Wise, so I report my earnings where I am living. Do I need to prove to Canada that I have paid my taxes in that country? Or will they not ask, as I am not a resident for tax purposes (yet - hoping point one is doable)?  Will Canada ask for tax return proof?

Advice sought - Capital Loss Carryback,3,"I suffered some serious capital losses last year (investments gone bad) and am looking for advice on how much to apply as a Capital Loss Carryback.

2021 tax year - I had a pretty decent capital gain (line 12700 was around 70k) but my actual income was pretty low (about 40k) ... and total taxable income around 100K. Paid around 15k in federal taxes and 8k in provincial taxes.

2020 tax year - no capital gains of note

2019 tax year - no capital gains of note

If I apply half of my losses against 2021 tax year gains I'll erase the capital gains completely ... but then I'd only be left with about 40k taxable income so best case is I get some of the 2021 taxes I paid back (maybe 20k)?

I could then save half 2022 capital losses to offset future gains (though I'm not sure where those gains will come from as I don't have a rental property to sell, etc).

I've had a tough go of things since moving to Canada right before covid, but am hoping my investments will come back, and that my business will get moving so wondering how much of my capital losses I should hold onto ...",2023-08-14 18:46:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/15r390h/advice_sought_capital_loss_carryback/

Child Benefit Nightmare,15,"In January (8 months ago) my partner and his ex received a letter saying their 5yo autistic daughter (my stepdaughter) was no longer listed as a Canadian citizen and would therefore not be eligible for the child tax benefit. 

My partner, his ex and their daughter are all born and raised in NB and have never moved out of the country. Every party has filed their taxes, and they did ask originally for the payment to be split between the two as they share custody. They sent in proof of citizenship (her birth certificate) and filled out all the forms.

They haven’t received any payment since this letter — and since then, CRA has given them beyond trouble. Constant runaround, constantly saying theyre working on the file, the system isn’t updated, etc etc etc.

In July the agent who was working on the case said the payments were coming but because it was too close to the date the benefits regularly get paid out, the system wouldn’t yet reflect that they are entitled to payment so they would actually only get it on August 18th and then would close his file.

This morning (Aug 14) my partner called again just to double check it was OK because his MyCRA hasn’t been updated yet. This new agent says there’s no payment scheduled, the file hasn’t been updated, he doesn’t know why. No one called us to say any of this.

At this point we are all extremely frustrated with this and struggling financially. 

Has anyone ever had something like this happen to them? What did you do? Can CRA just decide a child isn’t Canadian?",2023-08-14 12:01:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/15qsr0l/child_benefit_nightmare/

Accountant disappeared - advice needed.,1,"In 2022 my GF was working for her previous employer for the full year. Around October she opened a new business on the side, rented a space, purchased equipment and started seeing clients to cover the rent as she was still working 5 days a week for her employer at the time.

She dropped off her T4 from her employer and all of her receipts and documentation showing her income and expense with her accountant in May so he could prepare her taxes by end of June. He said that he did a preliminary check of her paperwork and that she won't owe anything and not to worry if she files late because she will be getting a refund. 

Then he misses an appointment with he in June, and is never heard from again. No one is answering his phone, I went by his office, the sign is out front still, but the door is locked and there is no notice on the door... He's in his 70s he could be dead for all I know.

It's possible that he will contact her in the future but just in case I want to understand what steps we should be taking. 

He had the only copy of most of the receipts (it's a small business, nothing is computerized, receipts are hand written, and she doesn't have a bookkeeper yet) we don't know what work he did or didn't do before he disappeared. 

My assumption is that if no taxes are filed for 2022 that the CRA will do an assessment later this year just based on the T4 that they have a copy of from her employer in 2022, and send her a notice of assessment... Is that correct? 

As for her business. The business was in operation for 3 months at the end of 2022. The income was minimal, just enough to cover her rent.  We have copies of some of the receipts but not all.  But most things were purchased on Credit or Debit so we could probably reconstruct her expenses using her bank and credit card statements. We don't have a copy of her receipt books but we would have her bank statements showing the daily deposits received from her merchant processor. So we could estimate her income I guess.  

If the accountant doesn't resurface do we just wait until it's time to do her 2023 taxes and get a new accountant to file an adjustment for 2022 using our best estimates of her income and expenses? 

(and yes in the future I guess we need to make copies of everything before handing over to an accountant)

Business Use of Home Expenses - question,2,"I have a small business (sole proprietor) but last year I was burnt out and mainly worked for a well-known company. 

I earned more than 80% of my money with the company (income tax deducted at source) ... and only a handful of jobs with my small business (around 10k in gross earnings ... and probably 2-3 weeks of actual work over the course of several months). 

When filing taxes, I'm not certain how to complete the Business use of Home Expenses. In 2021 I did way more work through my own company, and so expensed a portion of rent, electricity, heat, internet, phone, etc. 

However, I'm not sure whether to even include this now as it would be around 1/20th of the annual charges ... and I'm not sure how to account for that / explain if audited. And I presume the amount of money actually able to be written off would be quite low.

Non profit did not deduct tax from my cheques,0,"Hi all,

I work for a registered non-profit in Canada and as the title mentions, I got paid by cheques every month and these cheques did not deduct any taxes from the invoices I sent them. I have signed a contract with them and everything is above board with the organisation so I’m not sure why this or if this is just how non profits pay in Canada. In my contract, I think it mentions that I am an independent contractor who extends my services to the organization. Also they have had previous people with whom they did the same in 2019-20.

I work for this organisation part time for about $24/hour for 40 hours/month so that’s about $12k a year. 
I am also in university full time as a grad student. I have declared with my university through a TD1ON that I have another part time job so I get taxed more there but a large part of my money as a student comes from grants/scholarships which are tax free. 

I was just wondering if this was normal and if anyone knew approximately how much I would need to pay in taxes so I can set it aside for next year. I am planning to go to a tax prep agency anyway next year to do them but would appreciate any insight about what forms I should keep or how much I should expect to pay.

New calc for personal Minimum Tax,3,"The minister published an explanation today that was supposed to clarify the changes to Minimum Tax starting on 2024 tax year,  talked about last budget. https://fin.canada.ca/drleg-apl/2023/ita-lir-0823-n-1-eng.pdf  

Following is what I came up with, for the typical items normal people have .... but I'd appreciate someone with 'tax' to confirm it. 

1. Does the treatment of Canadian dividends remains the same?  In MinTx the $gross-up used to NOT get taxed, so 27.54% of the Taxable dividend on the normal tax return was removed from the MinTx return.
Q:  Is that still correct?

2. I could not parse what they say about capital gains on common stock.  Is the 30% they talk about,  the same additional 30% already added to the MinTax (resulting in total 50 + 30 = 80%) being taxed?... so no change?

3. I did not understand their change for the capital gains on stocks used for charity donations.  I can see they change something, but I don't understand what.  This cap gain  used to be completely tax free on the MinTax return.

4.  Basic exemption changes from static $40,000, to the bottom of the 4th tax bracket.  Last year this was $155,625 so estimate for 2024 at $170,000.
    
5. The tax rate applied to taxable income changes from 15% to 20.5%

6.  The tax credits list from the personal tax return (calc at the bottom tax rate) are no longer all deductible.  Only half that bottom line will be.       
Q:  Does that mean the huge credit for donations stays the same ( just cut in half like all the other stuff)?

Pay Spouse with Dividends or Subcontractor,2,"I opened an LLC with my spouse last year where each own 50% shares but have different classes.

The only contract we had was with a US company that I mostly managed on my own. My spouse did build our website and did most of the design, branding and some marketing materials.

 had limited active involvement with this contract

1. I get paid with a dividend and I pay my spouse a smaller amount $5000-$10000 for the website and design. My spouse will have to invoice the company as a sub-contractor but it seems weird to be doing that when my spouse is also a shareholder.   


We both do have room in our RRSP and FHSA to manage the tax burden on our individual filing so I'm not too concerned about the taxes we will have to pay when we take this extra income this year.

Tax for dual citizen Locally Engaged Staff (LES) at Canadian mission in United States,1,"I am a dual US-Canadian citizen and have never lived in Canada or filed Canadian taxes before. 

When we are onboarded at the mission, all Canadian citizens are required to obtain a residency determination from the CRA. As I was never a resident of Canada, they of course declared me a non-resident. However, they are required to withhold Canadian federal tax unless you are granted a waiver. 

Not knowing this beforehand, I applied for the waiver once I received my residency determination. The CRA does not grant retroactive waivers, so the waiver letter, which was successful, stated all my wages prior to the date of the waiver are subject to withholding, even though the letter is for a specific date range (my period of employment as written in my contract). This amount was small but not trivial. 

In order to get the money back, I was required to file a Canadian tax refund. This was obviously a headache since I had never done one before. When they processed my tax return, they created a My Account and the Notice of Assessment stated that I actually owed more tax than the withholding. According to guidelines, all LES who are non-residents and were not residents at the time of hiring (i.e., they did not relocate specifically to work at the mission) are exempt from Canadian federal tax. This is generally the case for any country, not just the US. Clearly the CRA made a mistake, but they told me to send a letter for an adjustment. The waiver letter is ambiguous and even CRA agents were confused by the phrase ""subject to withholding tax"" which doesn't necessarily mean I am liable for taxes, but merely that they be withheld. I don't know if they've even received the adjustment letter or are processing anything, but if I'm somehow required to pay federal taxes, I am going to quit. Even when they don't withhold, they still produce a T4 and report the income.  

This is all very stupid to me, as it wasn't even strictly necessary for me to disclose my citizenship status but for other reasons it was a condition of my employment.

Can anyone offer any advice? Did I file my tax refund incorrectly? How can I get the money back? I had to apply for another waiver for this year, but it was rejected because I was missing something and they failed to contact me because my phone number was written incorrectly.

Tax on starting content creator that not yet generating profit.,0,"Hello everyone,

I work full time for my day job, and recently me and my partner decide to put more effort into making vlogs and post on videos. I know that usually you report this activity on T2125, and somehow if CRA audit you, you need to justify your activity is ""business"" not ""hobby"".

I feel that for most content creators, it wouldn't be generating real profit from it until you actually get a lot of followers and views on YouTube, because there are cost unless you just filming your day to day life with your existing iPhone. We need to pay for software for video editing, buy camera that dedicate for vlogging purpose, travel etc. If I generated $0 profit, but spent thousands this year, can I put them on T2125 and deduct from my day job T4? In what scenario CRA would say ""oh this is not your new business, it's just a hobby""? Cus I believe most Youtuber don't start to make net profit in their first even first 3 years.

Taxes for a US citizen working as a consultant in Canada for a US Company,2,"I’m a US citizen working remotely as a consultant in Canada for a US company. I am a student of a Canadian University.

Any help is greatly appreciated!



Here’s my current understanding (quite possibly wrong):

* I must pay taxes in both Canada and the USA. As a consultant, I’m legally a contractor, so I must pay Quarterly installments in both countries

* In order to prevent getting “double taxed”, I can file the FEIE or FTC with my US return. If I want to be able to contribute to my Roth IRA, I should file the FTC because that way I have unexcluded income on my US filed taxes",2023-08-06 16:57:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/15juhra/taxes_for_a_us_citizen_working_as_a_consultant_in/
Can a non-Canadian Resident be a Representative for a Deceased Person (Form RC552)?,1,"U.S. resident here.  My uncle died without a will (Ontario).

How exactly do taxes work as a Canadian if I sell US(American) stock? No luck finding answer.,2,"Details are:

* Canadian citizen. Not a US citizen.
* Looking to buy 275k (value is in USD) worth of QQQ ETF. Let's pretend value goes up to 350k then I sell.
* Not day trading. Buy and hold for a while but will sell by end of year. maybe swing trade in future (very unlikely).
* What I think I know: 
   * I have to complete a T1135 form as I will have over 100k CAD worth in US stocks. What is the purpose of this form?
   * If I complete a W-8 BEN form, I'm taxed 15% on the dividends PROFITS instead of 30%. Can I have example of the amount I would be taxed on the dividend portion when I sell at 350k? (QQQ has a dividend yield of 0.58% and pays $2.15 per share. Paid every quarter. Share price $370).
   * once I don't buy and sell ETF to much, I'm taxed as capital gains on the profits. So 37.5k is added to my income and then I'm taxed. If I buy and sell many times (becomes business income) then 75k is added to income and then taxed.
* The 15% of the dividend profit that goes to American government, is that considered ""written off"" when I do Canadian taxes? So I'm taxed (as capital gains) on what's left after US government takes their 15% from the dividend?
* My advisor with my mutual fund (which is where my money is right now in Canadian dollars) is saying that 38% (so $28500) will be taken right off the bat (when I do end of year taxes) on whatever profit I make if I buy then sell an Americana ETF even once. He also said the remainder 62% (46.5k) will be taxed as capital gains. Is this correct?

What happens if the deemed acquisition price is lower than the actual acquisition price when establishing Canadian residency?,4,"[According to the Canadian Revenue Agency:](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it451r/archived-deemed-disposition-acquisition-on-ceasing-becoming-resident-canada.html)

> **Deemed Acquisition on Becoming Resident:**     
> A taxpayer who becomes a resident of Canada at any particular time in a taxation year is deemed under subsection 48(3) to have acquired at that time each property owned at a cost equal to fair market value at that time. Property that is ""taxable Canadian property"" as described in paragraph 115(1)(b), or deemed to be taxable Canadian property because of an election under paragraph 48(1)(c), is excepted from subsection 48(3).

As a U.S. tax resident moving to Canada this year, what happens if the deemed acquisition cost is lower than the actual price of acquisition? Will I have randomly lost money? For instance:

* Jan 1st (USA tax resident) living in the USA: Buys $500,000 USD worth of stock.     
* Aug 1st (USA/CDN tax resident) departure & arrival: The stock purchased for $500,000 USD is now worth only $300,000 USD.     
* Dec 1st (CDN tax resident) living in Canada: Sells all stock for $1,000,000 USD.     

Because of this deemed acquisition rule, will I have to pay capital gains on ($1,000,000 - $300,000) and incur a loss of $200,000 into thin air? Alternatively, is there a way for me to elect a higher ""actual"" cost basis?

Claiming internet and phone on T2125,5,"Hello,

I'd like to start deducing my internet and phone bill as a business expense. I didn't do it in the past as I wasn't making a lot of money and didn't have the time to invest in doing it properly.

Two questions:

1. My understanding is that I have to calculate a portion of internet and phone that I use for business. If I base it on amount of time spent on the internet/phone, I am certain this is above 50% as I've been investing a lot of time in the business, but I'd rather be conservative with this so that there are no eyebrows risen at the CRA. Is 60% a fair number? Should I have some sort of calculations to back this up? I am estimated to be bring in $30,000 this year from a business that's solely run on the internet if that helps at all. Note: my father lives in the house and also uses the internet. So maybe bring that down to 30% for the internet, and keep it at 60% for the phone bill?
2. Where on the T2125 do I put this? Office expenses or utilities under part 4?   
Or ""Other Expenses"" under ""Part 7 – Calculating business-use-of-home expenses"". I won't have anything else there as I'm currently staying at home to save up for my own house.

Tax accountant screwed up and cost 10's of thousands - What are my options?,28,"In 2018 I inherited my parents home.  We decided to keep it to rent out.   We spent \~$130,000 dollars renovating the unfinished basement into a properly coded rental unit.  Since we are going to start out renting and we spent all this money in renovations, we decided to hire an accountant firm to handle our taxes, since they would know better what can and can't be done.

So in 2019, my wife and I, got back about $31,000 between the two of us on our tax return.  Fast forward 4 years to this year, we got mail saying we were being audited.   CRA was saying that the expenses that were put on the income tax are Capital Expense and not Current Expense.  After I got the mail about the audit, I spent about 15min looking it up and even I came to the conclusion that it was Capital expense and not current, and I am not an accountant.

The firm screwed up.  We just gave them all the receipts and every other information we can think of, trusting they were the professionals and should know what can be put in and what can't.  They should have known better.

No we are going to be in the position of paying this all back as well as, I am guessing,  4 years of interest .   What are my options at this point?   Should the firm not be held liable?  We did not tell them to put everything on a expenses.  We did not lie about anything or try to cheat the system.  All we did was give necessary documentation to them and let them handle it since we had no idea.

We do not have the money right now to pay back what looks like it could be close to $40,000.  Do we need to see a lawyer or are we just SOL?

Capital Gains when Selling Mobile Home that family lived in,1,"In 2008, I purchased a mobile home in a seniors’ mobile home park for my elderly mother who was getting renovicted.

I did not make money from this, and in fact lost money; I never reported this as rental income to the CRA, since it was not an investment and I only held the mobile home so my mom would have somewhere stable to live.

Photo industry freelancer wondering how much I should put aside for taxes.,2,"\*I apologize in advance for likely misusing terms and wording\*

This year I have been up charing on some of my expenses/cost of doing business by 10% and passing the expense on to the client. for example if I rent photo equipment for a client for say $4000 I would pay the rental house $4000 and charge my client $4000 for gear + 10% mark up for $400 + 5% gst on top of that for $420 which equals $4620. But on the same invoice I might have say $2000 + gst in labour.

Normally I would set aside 20% for every payment received so that I was covered come tax time. But now that some of my invoices are very expense heavy at $1-5k a week in expenses (but i charge a 10% markup) I am curious how much I should be setting aside on a fluctuating paid invoice?

Tracking Capital Cost Allowances,4,"Anyone have any tips on how to track CCAs?  


I'm growing as a side-gig small business and will likely reach 30k in revenue this year, but it's taken me 5 years to get to this point. In the past, I've been very conservative when claiming CCAs as they seem like a bit of a headache. Right now I just have two assets on the books, a computer mouse and a studio light. I've put other smaller tools in the Class 12 and they've fully depreciated at 100%.  


I'm just a bit worried about keeping track of all this as I find it difficult to wrap my mind around. I don't really see a place to do this in my Bookkeeping software (Freshbooks); I think I could technically make journal entries but I'm a bit nervous to do too much as I don't want to mess things up. I have yet to go through the process of disposing of an asset, but I think I have an okay grasp of it.  


So far, my tax preparation software (StudioTax) has been keeping track of everything for me. Each year, it automatically inputs the old CCA data and I just put in any additions.  Is Studio Tax getting this information from the CRA or my old tax returns I filed using the software? If it's all housed in the Software, I feel like I should be tracking this outside the tax preparation software....

There really does have to be an easier way to keep track of all this. ",2023-07-31 02:52:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/15e47rm/tracking_capital_cost_allowances/

Calculating Canadian Capital Gain or Loss After Loan and Investment,1,"Consider the following hypothetical scenario involving trading with margin in Canada w/ made-up exchange rates:

 1. I take out a $100,000 USD loan on Jan/01 - ($150,000 CAD)

Is there any complexity to paying out HST for contractors?,2,"I'll try to keep this to the point, as I previously wrote a long post but lost it before posting.

As a sole proprietor, I'm at the point in my business where I need to begin hiring help. For the past few months I've paid my first gig worker $25k and they are on track to make about $40k working for me by the end of this year. They haven't asked for HST to be added to their regular invoices. Currently, I'm in the middle of hiring another contractor to help with my local service business but they are asking to be paid HST because they do other gig work and charge HST. If I hire them, they would earn about $30k working for me this year. I'm a newbie when it comes to tax and though I charge my clients HST, I put it aside and give it to the government each year. I'm wondering if I start paying this gig worker HST, would be as simple as just deducting that amount from the HST I would owe the government? And if so, should I be doing the same for my first gig worker as well, or are they fine to not charge HST since they don't have an HST number registered, while I pay my second gig worker HST?

T2209 help - foreign tax credit rejected,2,"When I filed my 2022 taxes I forgot that I held some US stocks in a non-registered account for a brief period of time during which dividends were paid out, for which I received a 1042-S.

Since I had already filed, I changed my return online to claim the foreign income (12100, T2209 43300) which was accepted, but my foreign tax credit claim (40500, T2209 43100) rejected on the basis that I didn't submit enough information.

I submitted the 1042-S along with my T2209; I'm puzzled how the same document was sufficient to prove income, but insufficient to prove taxes withheld?  The letter I received just provided laundry list of things that I could submit, but since I'm not a US tax filer the only document I have that is of any use is the 1042-S.

Before I muster up the patience to call the CRA, or file an objection, I wanted to check with the experts here to see if I missed anything obvious.  


Edit: Checking in earlier years, the only other time I've filed a T2209 was for $12 in income and under $2 in foreign tax credit, filed via NETFILE on initial filing.

Question - when is interest incurred while trading on margin deductible?,1,"To clarify my understanding of margin loans in Canada: the interest expense incurred while trading on margin is deductible, as long as the stock pays dividends, right? Also, if it is deductible, would the amount be deductible against all income, or is it limited to being deductible only against the capital gains and dividends that the stock generates?

For example, let's say I borrow 100k at a 10% annual interest rate from my brokerage firm to purchase a certain stock. Over the course of 1 year, the stock generates 1k in dividends. And when I eventually sell the stock, I receive 105k. Unfortunately, both the dividend and capital gain (1k + 5k) amount to less than the 10k I will need to pay in interest to my brokerage firm.

In this example, would I be able to deduct the full 10k of interest expense against all of my income (including employment), or is the maximum amount I can deduct just 6k (from the dividend and capital gain of the stock)?

P.S. In reality, the interest wouldn't just remain at 10k; it would compound and likely be something closer to 10.1k. I heard that compounding interest is also deductible, is this true?",2023-07-28 20:22:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/15c84bt/question_when_is_interest_incurred_while_trading/

* web hosting
* domain name annual renewals
* software with yearly subscriptions

I've been placing all three under **""Other (specify)""** and just leaving a note explaining what the expenses were. Never been questioned.

Am I doing this right? Or should they go under another category?

Need Help! CRA Denying Employment Expenses Despite T2200 and Taxable Travel Allowance,2,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm in urgent need of some advice and guidance regarding my situation with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). I work as a healthcare aid in a home-based setting, providing care to seniors and people with disabilities in their own homes. Unfortunately, it's been a tough ride as CRA is denying my employment expenses, even though I've provided them with a T2200 form from my employer.

Let me explain my situation: I use my personal car to travel to my clients' homes, and I'm reimbursed with a taxable travel allowance of $1.25, which is included in my T4. Considering the nature of my work, I've had to spend a significant amount on gas, car maintenance, car insurance, and even my phone bill to fulfill my duties effectively. Here's a rough breakdown of the expenses I've incurred:

Gas: $3,700
Car Maintenance: $2,100
Car Insurance: $3,200
Phone Bill: $960
On top of that, I also keep track of the mileage while working, which adds to the overall expenses. Moreover, since I've started working, I've already gone through three cars, which my work authorized due to my regular use of the personal phone for client communication.

The worst part is that despite all these expenses, I'm only earning $17.40 an hour for what I believe is one of the toughest jobs out there. It feels like I'm working for free and spending my own money and resources to care for people who aren't even related to me.

I've provided all the necessary documentation, including the T2200, but the CRA is still denying my legitimate employment expenses. It's becoming a huge financial burden, and I'm not sure if it's worth continuing in this job. I'm torn between whether I should keep struggling or quit my job altogether.

So, here are my questions:

Has anyone else faced a similar situation with CRA denying employment expenses despite providing a T2200 and having taxable travel allowance included in the T4?
What steps can I take to appeal or resolve this issue with CRA effectively?
Given the financial strain and the feeling of working for free, should I continue in this job, or is it better to look for alternative employment?
Any advice, personal experiences, or knowledge about how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance for your support!",2023-07-28 18:57:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/15c5y5j/need_help_cra_denying_employment_expenses_despite/

Canadian Entity not paying GST/HST - what do I do?,1,"Still trying to work this out through corresponding with them but it's take a while. So I figured I'd ask on here.  


I am part of an affiliate network where I make commissions on the sale of goods that links on my website generates. The network is originally based out of the USA but they have a Canadian entity that issues the payments.   


I don't directly invoice this company. Instead, they track my sales and calculate the commission. They then pay it out via PayPal. 

I'm guessing this company, since it's being paid through the Canadian entity, has to pay GST/HST? When I talk to their customer service they seem oblivious to it but they are forwarding the info to the accounting team. 

I'm also part of the Amazon.ca affiliate network, but they pay GST/HST automatically. Only thing I can think of is that they use a Network Sellers Method (described here: [https://www.ryan.com/contentassets/8c6655aaea954f6e93ef4fa0264ff56e/cra-gi-052.pdf](https://www.ryan.com/contentassets/8c6655aaea954f6e93ef4fa0264ff56e/cra-gi-052.pdf))... seems to make sense in my situation but this requires a joint election which I never filled out.  


If at the end of the day they don't pay GST/HST, what are my options? It was a relatively small payout, so we are only talking about $8 in GST. Do I just absorb it?   


I think I can prevent this in the future by just working with the USA entity and having the commissions paid in USD to my WISE account.

Income Tax Reassessment Charges,4,"Hi guys. I just got news that the CRA reassessed my 2020 taxes, and I owe them $ 1,258. I'm a student so this is a little hefty for me. 

I checked out the statement and now I'm simply confused. It seems like they're charging me for the Canadian Worker's Benefit and arrears interest charged. Is this because they incorrectly gave me the benefit in 2020? I was 19 and honestly don't even remember who did my taxes at the time. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Is there any arguing with the CRA since this was 3 years ago? I got quite a lot back on my tax returns this year, I wish they'd simply taken this charge from them and not hit me randomly in August after I've budgeted my year.

Are student health and dental plan premiums tax deductible?,2,"Basically the question. All the data I’ve seen online is from an employment standpoint, and basically employee-paid premiums are tax-deductible for the employee. If the analogy carries over, it would seem that the same is true for student-paid health and dental plans, but I can’t find anything about that specifically on the web, and I’ve never gotten any sort of tax form for the deduction, and it’s a pretty bizarre thing to omit considering almost every student is enrolled in one.

Looking for strategies to pay off CRA personal tax debt...,1,"Posting from a throwaway as my main is linked to people I know IRL.

In 2021, I had a great income year. I work in an industry that saw growth over the pandemic.

Prior to then, my income was about $30,000/year for the last 7 years and in 2020 was $65,000. In 2021, my income was $170,000 ish.

I fully admit I should have been more diligent about putting money aside for taxes, but I wasn't. I've never seen money like that and I was stupid. Sort of. I put about $60,000 away.

In 2022, I suffered a major health incident and was in a no-fault car accident. One left me unable to work, the other one cost a lot of money as my insurance didn't cover my own vehicle and I need a car for work (live in a rural area, public transit is not an option).

I didn't pay my 2021 taxes in 2022 due to the health situation taking up most of my mental capacity.

Last year I earned just under $30,000. I am now in a salaried position of $62,500/year

I currently owe the CRA a balance of $40,000 and change from 2021's tax fiasco.

I have $10,000 in my savings account.

My income is as follows:

Bi-weekly pay: $1,864 ($373 automatically goes into a savings account per pay)

Monthly expenses:

Mortgage: $1650  
Hydro: $120  
Natural Gas: $120  
Internet: $67  
Gas: $450-550  
Car insurance: $115 (I upgraded it after the accident to cover my own vehicle)  
Home insurance: $113  
Groceries: $450  
Streaming services: $15  
Gym: $75  
Pets: $120 (food and flea/tick prevention)  
Benefits: $110

The CRA says the best they can offer me as a payment plan is 12 months, so that is $3,360/month which is just shy of 75% of my monthly pay and would mean I couldn't pay my bills. They suggested I get a line of credit, but there must be another way... I just finished paying off all my outstanding debt from the car accident and medications that weren't covered by my benefits from when I had cancer.

How the heck do I feasibly pay back this debt?

I don't want to owe money, I intend to pay, but I feel entirely helpless.",2023-07-21 17:18:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/155u670/looking_for_strategies_to_pay_off_cra_personal/
Help with late father t3,1,"Father passed away Feb 2023 and I'm tbe executor. I'm working ahead a bit to looking at the final t3 for next year. 

For assests he only had principal residence and a share in family cottage. No cash or stocks or anything else but debt.

The estate has no money and I was hoping to do the final tax returns myself since it seems pretty straight forward.

The cottage deemed disposition will be reported on final t1 and was in joint tenants and his share was transfered to the other tenants after his death. We got a property appraisal as well.

Principal residence was sold 30 days after death and didn't increase in value since death.

For the t3 I'm going to be putting a gre trust and claiming the cpp death benifit and sale of the principal residence.

On the T3SCH1 I have filled it out as follows.
Year of acquisition: 2023
Proceeds of disposition: 308k (sale price)
Adjusted cost base: 308k
Outlays and expenses: 20k approx. Real estate and lawyers fees
Capitol loss: 20k approx

Does that seem right? Can I claim any carrying costs for carrying the house such as hydro, prop taxes, mortgage interest? after death

Then I'm going to amended his final t1 to carry back the loss and offset the gain from cottage.

I have bank accounts and a TFSA/RSP with Questrade. With the bank accounts I could either bring cash or wire transfer myself the money after moving, but I'm wondering about the investment accounts. I guess with a TFSA I could also cash that out and then invest it into a US brokerage when I have one set up. I've read some things about how you can't transfer an RSP directly to a US brokerage, and of course cashing it out and withdrawing has a lot of tax implications. I'd prefer to somehow get that money into a US brokerage as well, but is it even possible to do that?

The tax implication of gifting a house or selling under the FMV to a family member?,5,"Apparently it's not advisable for a parent to gift the full value or sell a house to their kid under the fair market value due to the double capital gain taxation pitfall. This article mentions three ways to do it more ""properly"":

https://www.moneysense.ca/columns/ask-a-planner/taxes-on-transferring-real-estate-to-kids/

For example, a mom want to gift a house to a son, if the property’s value is $500,000:
Option (1) He could pay a down payment of as little as $25,000 and borrow the other $475,000 from the bank; or 
Option (2) Mom might choose to have the son to pay mom $250,000, whether he borrows the funds or not, and give him the other $250,000 of value; or
Option (3) If mom's intention is to gift the full value to her son, there could be a benefit to taking back a mortgage for the full fair market value. In other words, mom could transfer a $500,000 condo to him and register a $500,000 mortgage at 0% interest. This could provide a degree of family law protection in the event that he and his spouse were to separate or divorce.

Can somebody please explain it to me like I'm 5 years old, how do option (2) and (3) work? Especially for option (2), can a private sale contract states a selling price of $500,000, but the mom will gift $250,000, so the son only needs to go get a mortgage for $250,000?

"Owe more than $20,000 of taxes + interest on previously unknown non-resident account",3,"Hello, I've received a letter from the CRA about a large amount I owe them. I filed my taxes (very) late for a few years on my resident account (with my SIN) and paid what I owe, but declared myself as non resident for tax purposes for those years.

The letter cites a non-resident account I apparently have (without my SIN) that I wasn't aware of as they sent mail to an address abroad until 2019 when they correct the address to match my ""actual"" account (with my SIN).

The rules are different for a non-resident account and my tax returns that were filed are apparently not accepted. That is despite the fact I was able to file - the two accounts (I guess) weren't connected in the CRA's systems until someone came in and did just that in 2019 (after I filed).

As a result, I can't deduct anything from my rental income in those years, resulting in a large owning amount plus 5 figures in interest. I just got off the phone with the CRA. My accountant who helped me with these said they can only talk to me in 2 weeks and that I should send them an email with the details. They have been non-responsive for years...

While I was indeed abroad for school and work, I still owned a home in Canada (that was rented out while I was away), had a Canadian mailing address (my parents') and can easily prove that my life was centered in Canada (I was enrolled in a Canadian University, went abroad as part of the program and decided to stay for longer. I filed as a non resident after advice my accountant gave me).

I was thinking of amending my returns and declaring myself a tax resident for those years so that my returns that I filed might be accepted. The last CRA rep I talked to said that might be possible but I'd have to talk to someone from personal tax. Otherwise, I'm considering asking for relief or using another avenue for appealing the amount.

I will talk to my accountant and try to reach out to another but my experience with accountants has been very poor, and not just this one. Ghosting, laziness and unwillingness to do anything beyond a simple filing (even if paid), lack of knowledge etc. so I thought I would turn to reddit for some advice...

Capital Gain on Rental Property Question.....,1,"Hello all! 

I have a question I hope someone could clarify for me. I'm working through a tax course and they give an example and solution that I'm having trouble understanding.

The jist of it is this. 

I buy a home in 2017 for $300K that I use as my principle residence. On December 31 2020 I move into a rental apartment, and on January 1 2021 I rent out that home to an arms-length person. At that time the market has decreased and FMV of the home is $250K. I do NOT make an election under ITA 45(2), and while renting the home I claim maximum CCA. In 2022 I sell the house for $450K.

My analysis is that there is a deemed disposition of the house when I start renting it out (remember no election to override change of use). The deemed POD would be the FMV at the time of $250K. Since this is below the ACB of $300K and there is a capital loss, but the home is not LPP, there would be no effect on my net income. Had there been a gain I would use the gain reduction formula for the principle residence  to reduce that gain to $0.

At the same time there is a deemed reaquisition of the property with a UCC of $250K. In 2022 when I sell the rental for $450 there would be recapture of the CCA I claimed for 2021, and a capital gain on the additional proceeds $200K. 

Here is where it gets weird. The text book solution lines up with my thinking, except they apply the principle residence gain reduction formula to the capital gains on the final sale post rental???

$200K - \[ $200K (4+1/6)\] = $33,333 for a taxable capital gain of $16,667.

I understand the use of the formula when you have two eligible personal  properties like a home and a cottage, or there was an election made to  override the change in use, but I'm at a loss as to why they would apply it at the time of sale after it was a rental property when they specifically state no 45(2) election. Even if there was an election claiming of CCA expense would have effectively revoked it?

Am I missing something? Or is this another one of those textbook errors that keeps me going in circles and wasting a half day of studying.....argh.

CPP,1,"A friend asked me to go over his taxes. He’s been doing them himself. 

He’s self-employed. Contributed to CPP until he turned 60 in 2018 (there’s definitely a contribution in his 2019 return). 

He started collecting CPP in the spring of 2023.  

Now he’s wondering if he should’ve kept contributing until he started taking it, thinking that he’d get more money. He wants me to go back and re-submit his returns for 2020, 2021 and 2022 in order to include CPP contributions.  Before I do this I want to know if it’s worthwhile, if he contributes for those three years will it change the amount he’s receiving now?

Sorry I just got this dumped on me and I’ve never done self-employment CPP. Worst case I’ll go to my bookkeeper but since I’m doing this as a favour I’m hoping Not to spend any money on it. 

The reason he came to me is because I have TurboTax installed going back to 2009 and he doesn’t know where his previous years copies are.  

If I know it’s worthwhile going back then I will do the necessary research to do it properly, but if it’s not worthwhile then I’ll just tell him that and we’ll move on.

Canadian green card holder declaring non-resident in Canada a year after departure?,2,"Hey folks, this subreddit has been incredibly helpful! Sharing my situation below and hopefully I can get some insights from you guys.

I moved to the US in April 2022 on a TN visa and despite meeting substantial presence test in 2022, I filed 1040NR and 540NR in the  US/California by using form 8833 (Canada/Tax treaty) and filed T1  reporting my worldwide income to Canada. My thinking then was that I am  not sure if I would stay in the US for long term and didn't want to  sever the tie with Canada after 1-2 years in the states. Also, I have a  home (primary residence) which I rented out when I left (filed  subsection 45(2) to continue to treat it as my principal residence).

Fast forward to July 2023, my wife (Canadian as well) and I were approved for green card - we started the application in Feb since her  employer sponsored it. We were thinking it might make sense to declare  non-resident in Canada at some point this year since my understanding is  that green card holders are supposed to file 1040 or at the risk of  jeopardizing the green card status. We will also be able to create some  tax savings due to lower tax rates in the US. Here is what I was  thinking in terms of structuring our situation: (FWIW I consulted with 2  cross-border tax accountants - one thought my plan should be fine while  the other was unsure...)  
 

* Fly back to Canada in mid/late September and return to the US on Oct 1  (we will use Oct 1 as our departure date and first day as non resident  of Canada - as such, file T1 with worldwide income for Jan 1 - Sep 30)
* For US, we plan to file a dual status tax return (i.e. we will file  1040NR/540NR for Jan 1-Sep 30 with form 8833 reporting US sourced  income; we will then file 1040/540 and report worldwide income for Oct  1-Dec 31)
* List my tenanted condo for sale and try to sell it in July and close  it on Sept 30 (there is $200K capital gain that should be tax-free since  it's my principal residence since day 1)
* Liquidate my RRSP and replace it with HXT (no distribution to minimize  tax reporting in California); liquidate and close TFSA as well as most  bank accounts (keep some bank accounts that serve non-residents); cancel OHIP :(
* From Jan 1, 2024 and onward, we will be resident of the US and non-resident of Canada

"Residency Status & Tax Implications for Canadian Permanent Resident Moving Overseas: Eligibility for GST Tax Credit, Climate Change Payments?",0," Hello there, Reddit! I have a question regarding the residency status and tax implications for my mother, who is a Canadian permanent resident currently residing in Alberta. I would like to know if she would be considered a non-resident Canadian if she plans to stay overseas at the end of this year and files her taxes next year, given that she will not be physically present in Alberta.

Additionally, I'm curious to know if she would still be eligible to receive certain benefits, such as the GST tax credit payment and climate change payments, which she received this year. Or would she need to forfeit these payments? It would be greatly appreciated if someone could shed some light on these matters.

Should I give up fighting my TFSA penalty? CRA is making me lose my mind,0,"Basically, I made a mistake thinking for years that my limit was higher because I counted a couple of years before I came to Canada (tons of calculators out there ask you year of birth not when you came to Canada). I consistently contributed the exact amount of my yearly contribution room and clearly aimed to be exactly what I thought was $0 but I was consistently over contributing those 2 years I counted other than 20ish days 3 years ago where I made a mistake counting the reset and took out that amount in less than a month.

This entire time my account was messed up because I changed SIN numbers so I wasn’t shown my real contribution limit (I was shown I was under the limit) and a lot of data was missing which I brushed off as delays in reporting. So this year CRA charges me 3k for not filing taxes for years (which I did file) but claiming benefits and I call them and it turns out my account was messed up.

They fix the 3k charge down to 0 and one or two days after I guess the system caught up when data was corrected and assessed me for 3 years of over contribution.

I sent CRA a long package explaining the situation and I’ve been calling them dozens of times because I also lost access to my CRA account for security checks and it’s been months since I sent them a fax with my documents to open it up again, so I’ve been calling them for hours just to check on things and make sure they don’t hit me with another bill I don’t know about then collect interest for years.

I’m at my wits end. Should I give up? Is there a physical location I can go to and talk about this in detail? Every 1-2h call with CRA drives me closer to insanity",2023-07-06 20:11:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/14skcfm/should_i_give_up_fighting_my_tfsa_penalty_cra_is/
Early RRSP Withdrawal as a Non-Resident,1,"I left Canada nearly 10 years ago and recently moved to Spain. Spain is applying a Wealth Tax to the gross value of my RRSPs (since they don't view them as pension savings) so I want to withdraw them early.

For my locked-in RRSP, the bank is requiring an NR73 form which I will submit to the CRA. 

My understanding is that the standard Canadian tax withholding is 25% and my lawyers in Spain have told me that I will only need to pay tax on the gains on my RRSP in Spain as Capital Gains rather than as income but for that, I will need a statement showing my contributions vs. the gains.

Questions:

1. Is there a way to check what my lifetime contributions to my RRSPs have been through the CRA? I've asked the bank for a report but they don't have records for the full contribution history.
2. I understand I can submit an NR5 and potentially pay less Canadian withholding tax but I don't understand how it works or in what circumstances would result in the payment of less Canadian tax?",2023-07-06 20:03:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/14sk4l7/early_rrsp_withdrawal_as_a_nonresident/

Withdraw RRSP for first time home buyer,4,"Need some help and got conflicting responses from my accountant and financial advisor. 

I made a RRSP contribution on May 29 and luck has it that I was able to find a home which has a closing date of Aug 17. I would like to use this amount towards a down payment. Given the 90 day rule, this amount can be withdrawn only after 90 days and that's on August 29. 

So, can I pay out of pocket and then withdraw the amount from my RRSP before 30 days after closing. 

My financial advisor said that's OK. 

But my accountant says, the RRSP withdrawal can only go from an RRSP account to a lawyer. The RRSP provider will not allow this withdrawal to go into my CHEQUING account. 

Please help. I really want to use that amount.

Capital gain strip or amalgamate into H Co.,3,"Hi there. Question regarding next step for a company with significant holdings. 

Have current holdco as retirement savings. Own another company 100% that is now done business and has ~1.6MM in cash after 10 years of work and recent partner buyouts. 

Share ownership for this company is owned by wife and I's holdco 100% so we have full control. I assumed it was personal but was wrong and now confused on what to do. 

Accountant is recommending a capital gain strip but also thinking that the liability would still remain with Holdco now (due to share ownership). Understand requires legal and around 25k in cost to do a strip and around 26% in tax percentage.

Concerned on company liability down the road if something were to be brought up and prefer no attachment to holdco as it's our retirement. Or amalgamate to Holdco and dividend out the opco? 

What would you recommend?

GST for Amazon.com (USA) Affiliate Income,1,"Posted this in the Canadian Small Business subreddit but got no response. So I figured I'd try here as I know there are lots of people engaged in side gigs on here. I figure I may cross the $30,000 revenue threshold later this year, so I want to get on top of this. Will likely consult with an accountant too, but need to find one that's familiar with the ins and outs of affiliate marketing.

Here's the original post:

Hello,  
I think I will cross $30,000 in revenue from my blog this year, so I will need to register for GST. The bulk of my revenue comes from affiliate marketing.

I know that for Amazon.ca affiliate income, I will be able to enter a GST number. Amazon.ca will then pay GST on my earnings and I will remit to the government.

Amazon.ca though only accounts for a small fraction of my earnings.

The bulk of my earnings come from Amazon.com(USA) Affiliate program. There is no place to put a GST number there.

Am I correct in assuming because they are an American customer, located outside of Canada, I do not need to collect or remit GST? Or will I just have to absorb the GST into the commissions paid since Amazon.com doesn't have a mechanism for collecting GST?

I make money from a few other sources and will look into them as well. But my big concern is Amazon.com as that is by far my largest source of income.

Deducting vehicle expenses for a business,4,"Hi!

Interested in getting a car for my new business (self employed) as it ramps up.  Probably will make around 30-40k on year 1 and then scale . Thing is, I need to buy a dedicated business car to really grow.  Already have a main car so I can separate personal/ business driving. I plan on scaling to like 185-250k on year 2 and with only 5 months left in the year, what is my smartest move ?

I heard about delaying the CCA.  Not really sure. 

My biggest concern is that the deductions just seem ridiculously high. My expected motor vehicles expenses  alone are like 400$ a month on gas  + 135$ on insurance + 86.11 interest (6200 interest / 72 months ) 

Purchase price: 23K + 3450 tx = $26450 

Heard about a 30% CCA rule, but then also the first year rule and the 100% exception for 2023. Got me confused.

How would this all work?

BC - Do I incur a capital gain tax in this scenario?,3,"My step mom passed away last month and my dad has me on the title of his primary residence house at a 33% owner for estate purposes. He has put the house up for sale that is in his community and has moved in with his sister in Alberta, because he can't look after himself. He is worried about me paying capital gains. The house is listed for $415,000 but I think he will get more in the range of $399,000 or less. He paid $135,000 for the house years ago. His health isn't the best, as he is 87, and has heart problems. He was wondering if would be better to take me off of the title and do probate, if he passes before it sells, or leave me on and I pay capital gains. I went on title in 2019 and didn't pay anything so its not an investment for me, I think fair market for the house then was $220,000. Not sure what the best course of action is?

Choosing Accountants; Sole Proprietorship to Incorporation,2,"I am in the process of choosing an accountant but would like some clarification on the transition from sole proprietorship to a professional corporation in Ontario.

I am a health professional graduating this fall and my 2023 income (combination of salary during school + income as fully graduated professional) will be \~150k, while my 2024 income should be \~$350k. Given my draw rate from the corporation would be in the \~$150k range anyways, I have accountants ""A"" and ""B"" saying that it makes sense for me to stay as a sole proprietor in 2023, and delay incorporation until 2024. This would save me 1 year of corporate accounting fees ($\~4k). However, accountant ""C"" says that delaying the incorporation doesn't save you any fees because there is an additional accounting and legal fee ($\~4k) to file the section 85 (or whatever election it is to avoid capital gains and GST/HST) rollover forms. ""A"" and ""B"" accountants say there is no fee for the transition, so I'm just trying to figure out what is going on.

Is it that accountants ""A"" and ""B"" are simply not charging to do these rollover forms, or is it that accountants ""A"" and ""B"" are undergoing a different process to transition me to a professional corporation? (i.e. instead of selling the sole proprietorship to the corporation, they are just cancelling the sole proprietorship?).

Canada/US Tax Help,2,"Hello, appreciate some guidance, ty! Having difficulty finding a simple answer on how I could be taxed as a dual US/Canadian citizen residing in both the US and Canada and working in the US.

Are the efficiencies to be had anywhere/somehow? Want to inform myself before speaking with a tax consultant, which is the next step.

Background:

Dual US and Canadian citizen working and residing in the US (NYC). I grew up and studied in Canada (Toronto) but have not filed taxes in Canada in 4 years, filing only US taxes since I moved after school.

Given the WFH flexibility (Tu-Th in-office in NYC) I'm considering being in Toronto Mo & Fr. I would rent a small apartment in Jersey City, this is my US residence, and (hopefully someday) own an house close to Toronto as my Canadian residence.

"Questions for filing taxes: T5008 transactions missing values, USD to CAD, and capital gains/losses",3,"I posted yesterday seeking recommendations on a clinic or advisor that could help answer questions for free since I'm in a tough spot to afford paying for something like that right now... but ultimately I was informed I could post here for some unofficial but potentially helpful advice or answers to my questions. So here I go.. and yes unfortunately this pertains to doing both my 2021 taxes and 2022 quite late.


**Question 1:** 

In summary, when I use Turbo Tax and import what's on my CRA profile, some of the book values (aka what I paid to acquire shares of stock) are showing $0, but showing the correct/full sale amount. Of course, this requires fixing since it would skew how much I owe if the book value isn’t there. But since the CRA is simply pulling info from my broker/bank, RBC, when I look at my RBC tax statements, they also don’t have my book value. They outright tell me on my statement for a handful of transactions: “***REPORTABLE TRANSACTIONS MISSING BOOK VALUES AND REQUIRE YOUR CALCULATION/INCLUSION***” — That’s odd, but to get this done, it looks like I can sift through documents showing my buy confirmations (this will help give me my book value). Sounds simple enough… but what do I do for circumstances where let’s say I bought 10 shares for $1,000 in a single buy transaction…. but I sold those in multiple different sell transactions, like 2 shares in March, 2 shares in April, and 6 shares in May. In that overly simplified scenario, would I simply use my average cost paid per share ($1,000 paid for 10 shares = $100 per share), and therefore my book value for each transaction/sale in TurboTax would be $200 for the 2 share sell, $200 for the other 2 share sell and $600 for the 6 share sell? 

**Question 2:** In addition to the above… the values being imported to Turbo Tax and the ones on the sell confirmations are all in USD, whereas all of my other transactions that are seemingly correct with no missing book values, appear to have their values correctly converted to CAD. Again this seems to stem from the RBC statements not having this info for whatever reason. When I do some Google-ing, I come across this from the CRA https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4091/t5008-guide-return-securities-transactions.html … which basically says I can “use the exchange rate that was in effect at the time of the transaction or an average rate that includes the transaction period” — Do you think it’s reasonable for me to use a historical rate found on XE.com/currencytables for that particular day? The only caveat being that I know RBC tends to charge me at a very slightly higher currency conversion rate, but of course, I have no idea what that would be since they simply don’t provide it. So in summary… do you think the rate I pull from XE for the transaction dates will be fine? https://i.ibb.co/vDJF0f0/image.png

**Question 3:** While I’m quite confident I’ll have capital gains that I owe from the 2021 year, I’m unfortunately quite confident that I’ll have capital losses from the 2022 year. Can I use capital losses from 2022 to offset or reduce the amount from a previous year aka 2021? I think the capital gains from 2021 is going to be quite little, but the capital losses from 2022, comparatively, are much larger. So is it possible the capital losses could end up completely offsetting what I’d owe for capital gains to bring it to $0?",2023-06-25 00:01:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/14i7jp8/questions_for_filing_taxes_t5008_transactions/

> For tax purposes, the CRA generally considers a gain or loss resulting from a short sale to be an income gain or loss (i.e. 100% taxable or deductible) and not a capital gain or loss (i.e. 50% taxable or deductible). However, there are circumstances in which the gains or losses from a short sale can be treated as a capital transaction.

Employer Submitted a T4 in Error,2,"An employer submitted a T4 in error (should have been T4a) for around $8000.  I informed the employer and they indicated they cancelled the T4 (late March, 2023) and sent out a T4a.  I filed and the CRA automatically amended my return to include the $8000 from the T4 (in error) **and** the $8000 from the T4A, resulting in around $4000 in overpaid taxes. For clarity, I was only paid $8000 (in a contract role, no taxes withheld) by this employer in 2022.

I double checked with the employer and they reiterated they had cancelled the T4 with the CRA in late March.  Looking on myCRA, the T4 is still there.

Is this typical for CRA to take so long to process a cancellation or should I be getting on the phone and speaking with someone?  It's a nightmare to get ahold of them and find time during the work-day but likely worth biting the bullet.

Translation of Documents to English,4,"So, like the title says, I need to translate a document to English.

And the guidelines the CRA gives are :

&#x200B;

""If any of your documents are in a language other than English or French, we need a copy of the original documents written in the foreign language with an acceptable English or French translation.

To be acceptable, the signatory’s name has to be printed, in the Latin alphabet, and the translation has to meet one of the following conditions:  
\- be certified by an official with the authority to administer an oath or solemn declaration (commissioner of oaths, notary public, or lawyer) unless it was done by a translator who is a member in good standing of one of the provincial or territorial organizations of translators and interpreters of Canada  
\- have the seal and signature of an official from the foreign country’s embassy, high commission, or consulate confirming it is a true translation  
\- have the signature of the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) confirming it is a true translation  
\- have a written statement indicating the profession and the signature of a teacher, professor, or a religious leader confirming it is a true translation""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm wondering about the last guideline of ""have a written statement indicating the profession and the signature of a teacher, professor, or a religious leader confirming it is a true translation""

Is it really that easy? Can I just get the pastor of my small church or one to the teachers I work with here in Japan to just say ""yeah, that's a good translation""? (The document has a pre existing translation though my work, just not one that's certified or notorized or anything. And I'd rather not pay a couple hundred bucks for that if I don't have to)

Does anyone have experience with doing this?

Changing Residency Items,3,"Hoping to get some second thoughts on my tax obligations  


1. I moved to the US in August 2021 under a TN visa
   1. I believe this means I did not pass the substantial presence test nor the greencard test
   2. and that I am not a tax resident until Jan 1, 2022
2. Therefor, I believe I could be considered either a Part Year resident or a deemed full year resident of canada
3. I believe I am a full year resident because:
   1. longer than 183 days
   2. no significant residential ties to canada (home, spouse or kids anywhere)
   3. tax treaty (a bit unsure about this one).
4. Even if they argued I was a part year resident, I hold the stance that I my date of departure is Jan 1, 2022. The date of departure is the latest of:
   1. when I leave
   2. when my spouse leaves (N/A)
   3. the date which I become a (tax) resident of the country I imigrated to (thus refer back to section 1.2 for my date of Jan 1, 2022)

Yes, I know it's late. I am sorry. But my plan is:  
1) File 2021 as a full year deemed resident in Canada, claim my wages as foreign income, and my taxes withheld as a foreign tax credit.

2)  Look into how to file my departure and deemed disposition of assets as of Jan 1 2022. 

3) file US taxes starting 2022 (i missed this date too, woops).

Is there anything I should consider? I am also open / hoping to hire a CPA to help me with this.  Other than the change in residency, I just have my standard W2 and a few trades / interest income.

I am actually a CPA myself, but I'm not much of a tax guy. My papers are in order though.

CRA's bookkeeping of individual tax accounts unnecessarily complex,1,"Does anyone else find that when logging into CRA's ""My Account"", the accounts are extremely confusing?  They have a ""Tax Account"" and an ""Installment Account"", which are not explained.  The rules governing where your payments go are opaque, as are the rules governing when and how much automatically transfers between accounts.  Neither the formation of these two accounts, nor the rules for transfers, seem to be user controlled.

It used to be that I owed CRA some amount and I paid it.  Now, it goes to some account, which may or may not get transferred to the right destination account in a timely manner.  Even worse, when trying to assess the state of one's owings to CRA and how that came to be, the user is presented with a series of seemingly random transactions for both accounts, including the opaque transfers between them.

At what point is CRA responsible for telling you what you need to know and not burden you with its internal bookkeeping, on which you have no say?  It seems that the latter obfuscates the state of financial obligations between the individual and CRA.  It definitely makes it mysterious how transactions came to be, which culminate in the balance owing to CRA.  In fact, the very world ""balance"" is now muddy, as it means different things depending on the account, of which there are now more than one per individual.

Looking for tips on how to restructure borrowings between rental property and personal use,1,"Hi there! I know it is technically ok to restructure and probably commonly done, but I'm not really familiar with how people do it and would appreciate any suggestions.

My husband and I own a primary residence with a mortgage balance of $360K and a rental property (condo) with a paid off mortgage. There is a line of credit on the condo with an annual rate of 6.7%, limit of $185K, and current balance of $7K. We currently use the line of credit for rental expenses only.

I know it's possible to restructure so that more of the overall debt meets the ""direct use"" test for the rental property, but I'm not sure what's the best way to do it. I'm hoping maybe some of you out there plan these kinds of transactions routinely and might be willing to share how this is typically done.

I was thinking: take money from the line of credit to pay down the personal mortgage, then get a mortgage on the rental property to pay off the line of credit. Is that the way to do it? Would appreciate any suggestions on how best to do it.

Thank you for your help!

EDIT: Hmmm ... the first responses seem skeptical, so maybe this isn't as commonplace a thing as I thought. For context, the reason I think restructuring borrowings to meet the direct use test is ok is because CRA says it is in Folio S3-F6-C1 at [para. 1.33] (https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-3-property-investments-savings-plans/series-3-property-investments-savings-plan-folio-6-interest/income-tax-folio-s3-f6-c1-interest-deductibility.html#toc16). My suggestion of how to do is meant to follow what the guy did in Singleton (referred to in para. 1.30 of the same Folio). Some different facts in that case for sure though.",2023-06-18 15:38:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/14cng51/looking_for_tips_on_how_to_restructure_borrowings/
DTC - Change my return vs REFILE,3,"Our child was recently approved for the DTC so I went online and used “Change My Return” to apply the credit to our taxes from 2017(approval year)-2021. For all 5 years, it has said reassessment in progress for the past week, with a targeted completion date of August 9th.

2022 wasn’t available in Change My Return, so I used Turbo Tax, which I normally use to file our taxes, and did a REFILE for 2022 to add the credit. The one automatically generated an express NOA and the full NOA and deposit to our account will be done later this week.

My question is, is it normal for “Change My Return” to take so much longer? I thought they were similar software?

12mo+ visit to Europe,8,"Posted this in r/personalfinancecanada but was advised that posting here would he a better option.

Wife and I are currently in the planning stages of what we would like to be a roughly 12-14 month trip to Europe and are wondering if this length of absence would require us to inform the government or register in some way to avoid triggering departure tax or similar if we're away over 183 days one year?

This would be a one time event driven by my wife's parents poor health (Sweden) along with an opportunity to take a leave of absence from work presenting itself.

Given that we have strong ties to Canada through house ownership, investments, jobs, banking ect is there really much risk that we could be deemed to no longer be residents of Canada for tax purposes simply due to the length of time we'd be away? 

We both have dual Canadian/Swedish citizenship so not an issue for us to be in Europe for an extended visit given that we won't be registering or residing aside from as tourists.

Money transfer from UK bank account to Canadian Bank Account any declaration required to CRA?,1,"Hi

Long story shot.

I came from UK in 2016 on a Work permit wasn't sure if I will be staying in Canada for longer so left my UK bank account opened with a significant amount in it that I earned as salary during my time there its all legitimate money with taxes paid on it what so ever.

When I was first filling taxes in 2016 I remember my accountant asked me if you have any assets outside Canada and I told her about this account and the amount in GPB in it but I am not sure where can I check this now if this was mentioned/declared to CRA.

I got PR inside Canada so never did a full/final landing (where you travel from your country and bring in all the assets inside one time) and now I am citizen finally and want to transfer that money to Canada for the purpose of buying a property or getting it invest as its been sitting idle.

My question is if I transfer from my UK bank account to a Canadian Bank account do I have to declare anything to CRA will I have to pay any kind of tax on it etc anything I need to be aware of. I don't want to get any double taxation on this amount as the amount I have all already paid taxes in UK they cut it at the source like when you get the salary it's all automatic, unlike  Canada where we have to file taxes every year.

Not sure how much non-capital loss I can carry back to a prior year,4,"In 2022, I only had business income loss. In 2021, I had business net income and capital gains. I'm not quite sure how much loss I can carry back to 2021 (assume no income in 2019 or 2020).

This is all very confusing to me; I might simply report the business income loss and let it carry forward indefinitely...

Here are my figures for 2021 and 2022:

2022 tax year
- Business income loss: 140,000
- No other income to report

2021 tax year

- Alberta non-refundable tax credits: 3,600

After reading the link below my understanding is that if the contributions that lead to over-contribution is a result a group plan then the 1% fee isn't applicable. If this is true, is there anything I should do (e.g. fill out the T1-OVP form)?

Donations review from CRA,7,"Hey there, friendly stranger.  I recently received a CRA review letter for donations made ~ $10K to Canadian and US charities.

Is it sufficient to send the official donation receipts from the registered charities or is it also necessary to show proof of payment e.g. credit card statements?

Will the NOA that i will receive for tax year 2022 show the $5k in “Unused RRSP contributions previously reported and available to deduct for 2023”, which gets minus from my total contribution which then tells me that i only have $5K room left because I already carried over $5K that i excess contribute the beginning of January 2023?

Change of use (rental to primary residence),2,"Doing some tax planning for my parents as they are retiring and just wanted to see if from what I understand is correct since they want to sell their primary residence.

Background:
Parents have two homes one purchased 30 years ago and a rental property purchased 10 years ago.

They plan to sell their principal residence/my childhood home today and of course given this is their principal residence they will claim PRE and no tax on capital gains on their primary residence.

After they sall they may potentially move into part of the rental property (could also buy a condo or move somewhere else to retire) but assuming they move into the rental property. Of course this is considered change of use of the rental property and considered a deemed disposition at fmv in the year they sell the primary residence and move into the rental property.

However, they can elect to defer this tax liability based on subsection 45(3) and not pay capital gains until the actual eventual sale of the property. And file a letter applying subsection 45(3) in year of sale. 

The part that I want to get some clarity on is that the election allows up to four years to be designated during the rental period. Does this mean that for example if my parents end up selling the property after owning for 20 years (10 years rental and another 10 years primary) the calculation for PRE means that when the property gets sold they can say 14 years primary and 6 years rental and upon sale the capital gains liability will be 6/20 years rather than 10/20 years?

If someone has any advice or knowledge on this that would be great. Just want to confirm, parents don’t have to pay a deemed disposition tax liability immediately and defer until it is sold and they can get an extra 4 years as principal residence.

Switching from software consulting to own startup - worried about tax audit/review,1,"I created a Quebec incorporation in 2022. I did some software consulting. Revenue was \~$150k and expenses \~10k, most of the expenses were for tech gadgets/equipments (no salary, almost no travelling/meal expenses). Filed the 2022 business tax returns (federal, quebec, gst/qst) and all tax returns were accepted smoothly (no questions/documents asked by CRA or Revenue Quebec).

&#x200B;

I recently lost the clients, and not expecting any further revenue this year. Expected revenue for 2023 will be \~100k. Now, I am planning to focus on building my own software product and sell it directly (kind of startup), using the same incorporation. However, it would require lot of expenses upfront (e.g.: buying lot of high-end laptops/computers), might be $50k. Also, there might not be any revenue from it for long time, or I might fail at building/selling the product.

&#x200B;

My question is about taxes. If I go ahead with my idea and do the large purchases, will it create a red flag on my 2023 tax returns as it will show large expenses (\~50k), much larger than last year, and lower revenue compared to last year. Will it increase the chances of getting audited/reviewed by CRA for those expense? Also, does that kind of expense (\~$50k) look very high to trigger audit/review? Or is there a particular number where the expenses might seem unreasonably high and trigger audit/review?

&#x200B;

Would CRA ask for explanation about why did I need to buy that expensive or that many computers, why couldn't I manage with less expenses?

&#x200B;

Should I be thinking from tax perspective, or just focus on the idea/startup and do whatever is best for business? And if I have business purpose and have receipts for all the purchases, would that be enough?

After filing my taxes this year, I received two GST/HST notices. 

First one says,

Confirmation by me or my spouse or common law partner if my marital status and the date of the change, as well as spouse’s name and social insurance number. 

We need to know your spouse’s 2020 net income to calculate your credit. 

If this individual immigrated during 2020 or after, we need the date of entry and how much world income, converted to Canadian dollars, he or she earned before coming to Canada(if not already provided)

Resident in Canada working remotely for US company - tax questions,6,"I am understanding a few things here, but having trouble putting it all together. Assuming I am ean employee (not independent contractor) of a US company and work remotely, I think I understand:

* If I am resident in Canada (meaning i reside in Canada for >183 days of the year and/or have other ""significant residential ties"") I have to pay tax in Canada on my worldwide income
* To the extent that I paid US taxes, I am entitled to a foreign tax credit on my Canadian tax return equal to the *lesser* of tax paid to the US, and the tax I would have paid on that same amount of income in Canada

First question - the above made sense to me, *except* for the fact that it seemed the IRS would potentially be getting all of my taxes (assuming the top-up to Canadian tax is not too significant). If I am resident in Canada, why should the IRS take all the tax revenue, given I benefit from Canadian infrastructure? Is this just how the tax treaties work or am I misunderstanding something?

Second question(s) - today I was told that US employers of Canadian residents actually have an obligation to set up Canadian payroll accounts, and withhold/remit payroll tax on salaries paid to Canadian resident employees. If a US employer does this, does the tax withheld still flow through my T1 as a foreign tax credit, or if not, how is it reported? And what (if anything) are the consequences to me if the employer does not withhold/remit taxes to CRA, and instead remits to IRS?

Whenever we go for a team dinner, one staff member pays the bill with their credit card, and expenses it to a partner, then gets reimbursed.  This is reimbursed in the form of an ETF remittance and is processed similarly to how are ADP salary payroll is.  As far as I know, this is added as a taxable benefit to the staff member - the full $3,000 it may have cost to feed a team of 22 people is added to the taxable income to one individual.  Since this individual is an employee, there is no way to deduct this at year end?  That does not seem fair at all, and it seems like no one at the firm is aware of this issue.

Similarly, isn't this a cheat code for the firm.  The firm pays $3,000 as reimbursement to the employee after getting the receipt.  Then, it shows the receipt as a meal expense for the firm.  But also has the $3,000 remitted to the employee as a benefit expense?

Airbnb Class 8 Depreciables,4,"CRA says for Class 8 ""Class 8 (20%)

Class 8 with a CCA rate of 20% includes certain property that is not included in another class. Examples are furniture, appliances, and tools costing $500 or more per tool, some fixtures, machinery, outdoor advertising signs, refrigeration equipment, and other equipment you use in the business.

Photocopiers and electronic communications equipment, such as fax machines and electronic telephone equipment, are also included in Class 8.""  


Furniture I purchased for the airbnb, most of it is under $500 but collectively it's a lot more. I intended to write off say a mattress that is $400 purchased at Costco with a bedframe purchased at Ikea for $229 which would put the ""bed"" over $500 so this would be Class 8, depreciable. 

For furniture like a coffee table that is $199.99, it appears I would not depreciate it but write it off the year purchased (because it is under $500.00). Same for Ikea dishes, or towels, bedding etc.  


Is this correct?

Edited to add Class 12 which is 100% deductible in the year of purchase (so kitchen utensils for the airbnb):

Class 12 (100%)
Class 12 includes property such as tools, medical or dental instruments, and kitchen utensils that cost less than $500 and were acquired on or after May 2, 2006.

Class 12 includes china, cutlery, linen and uniforms. It also includes video-cassettes, video laser discs and digital video disks that you rent and do not expect to rent to any one person for more than 7 days in a 30-day period.

Most small tools in Class 12 are not subject to the half-year rule. They are fully deductible in the year of purchase. If the tool costs $500 or more, include it in Class 8 with a CCA rate of 20%.

Writing off a training agreement,2,"Hello,

Common practice for my profession (pilot) is to sign a training agreement covering the costs of training if one is to leave the company within the agreement.

In my case, the agreement is for $40,000 and is reduced daily over a 2 year period (730 days).

I may have a job offer that is much better long term and I would look to break the agreement with approximately 425 days remaining. This equates to $23,287.67.

Is this something that I can write off as an employee? If so, do I need anything from my employer to do so.",2023-06-02 21:52:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/13yqn4n/writing_off_a_training_agreement/
Change of use valuation,3,"Bought a house for $233k in 2008. It wasn't our principal residence at first. Change of use to principal residence occurred December 31, 2012. I got a real estate valuation at that time that the house was then worth $275k. I figured we needed to pay capital gains on that difference of $42k. I received advice from two accountants that we didn't claim that capital gains until we sold the house. We did that a few years back and I was a few years behind on my taxes (I know, I know) so the review letter I received only came in now. 

I consulted with another accountant who confirmed that indeed, we only claim that capital gain when it becomes realized, in the year we sold the house. The CRA is telling me that since we didn't pay capital gains at the time of the disposition (2012), we can't use that valuation of $275k from 2012, but instead just the formula that takes the difference between the buying and selling value, multiplied by whatever fraction of the time the house was not our principal residence. Because of real estate market going up like crazy, as well as a ton of work we put into the house, this results in capital gains being calculated on almost $115k instead of $42k. 

Is there a way around this? I asked if we can go back and revise our 2012 return to report the capital gain then, but the CRA rep said it was one year too late to go back to 2012, and also the penalties would probably add up to as much as paying taxes on the higher amount. 

Is there no way to get them to take into account the formal valuation of the house that was done as of the change of use?",2023-06-02 21:05:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/13yp6yl/change_of_use_valuation/

I am in process of getting Canadian Permanent Residency (PR). I am now confused about my taxes. Though I plan to go periodically to Canada, I don't plan to be there for extended period of time for the next 3 years. Once I get my PR, will my taxes increase ? Or will it remain the same? I am assuming my taxes will increase because I need to pay the US government and ALSO Canadian government. Am I right? Is anyone has experience in this situation?

Seeking Advice on Claiming Spousal Amount for Non-Resident Wife,5,"I've been doing quite a bit of research and would like to seek advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation. I'm considering **claiming my wife to get the spousal amount**.

Before diving into the specifics, if your experience suggests it's **not worth saving $2000** due to the complexity of this situation, kindly let me know upfront.

If I claim my spouse, my tax liability decreases from **$5000 to $3000 - a savings of $2000**. The challenge here is that she is currently a non-resident living in Germany. My research suggests I can claim her, but considerations around the cost of living and the support she receives may complicate the matter. All details are outlined below. I'm considering whether the potential $2000 saving is worth the possible headache in case of an audit, despite being fully prepared with all my financials organized.

The relevant provision for my case:

>**""Amounts for non-resident dependents You may be able to claim an amount for certain dependants who live outside Canada if they depended on you for support. If the dependants already have enough income or assistance for a reasonable standard of living in the country where they live, the CRA does not consider them to be dependent upon you for support.""**

**Key points**:

* Relocated to Germany in Sep 2021 (resided in Canada for over 6 months in 2022)
* Married in Denmark in August 2022 (to avoid German bureaucracy)
* I am self-employed, and was unable to work in Germany due to visa restrictions; maintained Canadian residency by residing in Canada for 6+ months prior to marriage
* Supported rent and other expenses for our 1-bedroom apartment
* My wife is a university student, and I earned significantly more ($20,000+) than her
* All rent and expense payments made from my German bank accounts were not direct payments to her

**Details of my wife's income and cost of living for the year** (all in CAD):

* \~$4500 from part-time jobs
* \~$1500 support from her mother
* Education costs less than $1000
* Single person's estimated monthly costs (excluding rent): $1,276 (880.5€)
* Apartment rent outside city centre: $1,129.61 per month (Source: Numbeo)[**https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Stuttgart?displayCurrency=CAD**](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Stuttgart?displayCurrency=CAD)

I have not included the following in her income:

* Bafög (German student loans intended for low-income earners to support their children). Since she has to repay 50% of this, I don't consider it as income. Only the tuition and education costs not covered by Bafög are considered. Her Bafög loan amount fluctuated during the year, but we estimate it to be around $6000.

**Final calculations for the year**:

* Cost Of Living: **$28,867.32**
* Income (without including Bafög): \~$6000 CAD
* Income including Bafög: **$12000**

Considering all factors, **she is $16,867 short of the cost of living** even with Bafög. I believe this deficit substantiates my claim.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, advice, or experiences on this matter.

1. Work at my full time co op
2. After hours work at the other communications job
3. Work once on Sundays as a receptionist

My questions:
1. I’m getting heavily tax deducted on my full time co op job, since I claimed them on my receptionist job first. Can we reshuffles my tax claims and submit new taxes forms in order to get a higher take home pay at my coop?

She was the sole owner/director of a corporation that perhaps grossed a few hundred dollars each year in the last few years and the net result was probably a loss.

Before she died, she checked into a hospice and didn't tell me. She also essentially left everything to the dogs with no fucks left to give.

Long story short, now the CRA wants me to file returns for this corporation. However, the corporation has been long since struck since taxes and GST hasn't been filed for a couple years.

I can't answer any questions the CRA needs me to answer to be able to speak about the company. First they ask me to file an RC552, then when I told them I did send it in and it was rejected because I was not listed on the corporate registry, they tell me it is on the corporate registry to fix this.

Next I speak to the corporate registry and they give me a long explanation about how the CRA always does this to them and explains why they can't help me either. 

I've been going in circles back and forth between the Corporate Registry and the CRA for months. My most recent call with the CRA ended with the agent saying bluntly that they can't disclose of this, but this can't be the first time this has happened to someone, so I need to find a way.

Does anyone have any insight?",2023-05-25 18:12:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/13roxt2/cra_wants_me_to_file_returns_but_wont_disclose/

Max Late Penalty and Interest,5,"Hello Guys,

I few weeks ago my mom was hit with a tax penalty as this year she realized her T1135 form last year did not send when she filed her Netfile. The program is called Studio Tax and though it filed her taxes it did not send the T1135 file as well. She freaked out and went to last year's version and click send just in case. But did not realize this will become a max penalty with interest. So a heft $2,700+.

We called for help to see what we could do. The CRA agent told us to mail a letter to the Winnipeg location that takes care of T1135 forms. And he told us it may or may not be waived. From what I read online, it sounds like it is not likely unless it is extraordinary circumstance. I was wondering if anyone else was able to at least reduce the penalty? 

Any information will do, I just want to know whether or not CRA gives a crap. Or just forget it and call it a life lesson.

Basic Personal Amount,1,"Could someone explain how basic personal amount works?

At first, I was thinking about it as a first (0% tax) tax bracket, but then I learned that some people don’t qualify for the basic personal amount, so that’s not the best way to think of it.

Is it essentially a tax credit, but it reduces your net income by $15,000? So it kind of acts like a deduction to net income?

Where along the line is the basic personal amount applied? Like, if I made $100,000, would this be the first amount deducted from my income? So I’d then have a net income of $85,000?

And then after that, other net income deductions and tax credits would be applied?

Capital Gains Tax,0,"
Hello All,
I bought an apartment for $480k with mortgage of $380k in 2020. I lived there for almost 1.5 years till April 2022.

In April 2022, I refinanced it and bank appraised the apt for $650k and I got the money out and mortgage became $550k. Bank did the 80% rule of mortgage.

Then I bought another apartment with that refinanced money and start living there. And rented out the previous apartment.

I rented that apartment for almost 1 year and now sold it for $600k April 2023.

I’m yet to file my taxes for 2022 and planning to do it this weekend. Just curious, what would happen next year as I have sold this property.

My questions:
1. Do i have to pay capital gains tax on this? If yes, will it be from original price or from refinanced mortgage one.
2. How can i avoid paying gains tax? As i have lived there, can i make it my principal residence?
3. Reading about section 45(2), how will this section help me?

Thanks very much.",2023-05-24 12:38:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/13qkh7y/capital_gains_tax/

Dividing Corporation Prior to Divorce,1,"My wife and I are directors of a small corporation (Alberta) that holds ownership of two rental properties and also receives revenue through consulting activities.  We are looking for options for dividing the company prior to filing for divorce, but we don't know what the tax implications are, or what issues may arise through the various methods that we have thought up.

Here are the ideas that we have had:

1. Create a second corporation and transfer ownership and an agreed portion of the cash holdings to that corporation.
2. Sell one property (they are about equal value, one about 10% more than the other, $330K and $300K) and I would take the proceeds after tax as a dividend
3. Sell both properties, each take dividends.
4. She keeps both properties, then uses the HELOC to pay me out, I am removed from the directorship.  This seems like I would be liable for default anyhow, since my signature is also all over the HELOC contracts.  Are there other reasons that this is a bad idea?
5. The reverse, I use the HELOC and buy her out.

She is a contractor and receives her payments into the company.  I am an employee of another company, and receive a T4 from them, but years ago I was a contractor and used the company for receipt of revenue.

Questions: 

Timing - benefits to doing this prior to divorce, or drawbacks, tax-wise?

Dividend - Drawbacks to taking a $300K dividend

Transfer - What are the corporate tax issues that arise from creating a second corporation and transferring assets.

Tax mechanics of using options paid in BTC,1,"I would like to better understand the tax implications of using options that are transacted in BTC. For the sake of it lets consider the following situation and the subsequent questions.

Lets assume someone has BTC holdings purchased with an average price of A (say A = $40000).

Let's assume the current BTC price is P (say P = $20000).

&#x200B;

1. Suppose a call option is purchased with a cost of 1BTC. At this stage I'd assume a capital gains event is triggered and in this specific case, it results in P-C = -$20k, or a 20k loss. Am I right?
2. Suppose now the option expires worthless. We lost the premium which at the time was worth 20k. This would give us an additional capital loss of 20k. Is that correct?
3. Finally, suppose the option expires in the money, and we receive the payout in BTC. Then the CAD value of the amount received at the time of expiry is considered for capital gains. The average buy price A for our BTC holding is adjusted accordingly. Is this the correct way to treat this?

Incorrect cost basis leading to tax saving,0,"My friend (Canadian resident) transferred large number of TSLA stocks (which she bought over the years at a very low price) from a US brokerage (like Robinhood) to IBKR Canada (regular margin account) in 2022.  


However, the Cost Basis was not transferred properly. For one of the large transfer the cost basis in IBKR is shown as the market value of TSLA on the day of transfer (much higher than the actual cost basis, reducing her taxable gains)

She doesn't understand the nitty-gritty of cost basis. She is wondering what will happen if: 

\- She doesn't update the cost basis in IBKR and sell all the stocks now

\- The tax form generated after end of year (probably T5008) will use the higher cost basis IBKR has.

\- She simply file her Canadian (CRA and revenue-quebec) taxes using that information.

\- This will result in using higher cost basis thereby saving on capital gain taxes.

She is saying that the chances of CRA noticing any inconsistency is close to zero since her tax return will match exactly with the information CRA receives from IBKR about those transactions. Is that true?

&#x200B;

Also, for another stock transfer it's showing multiple lots, each lot with different cost basis, but some of it the wrong. IBKR is allowing to update the cost basis of those transferred stocks online easily (without any documentation). She is wondering what if she update the Cost basis of those stocks as well to market value of stock on the day of transfer (higher CB). It can save tens of thousands of dollars in capital gain tax.  


I advised her that it might be a tax fraud. She understand it, but think the chances of CRA noticing is extremely low, and if CRA find out, she can mention that she didn't understand cost basis properly, got confused and did it by mistake and then pay the penalty. She says she understand there is a risk, but risk is low (as CRA wouldn't likely find out about incorrect cost basis, and won't doubt it as it matches the information on their records from IBKR) and reward is high in this scenario, making it worth to try.

What do you think?

(Extra info: She does NOT do any day-trading, lives in Quebec, she has substantial employment income (few hundred thousands annually, working in a reputed multi-national company) and pays taxes honestly, never had CRA audit; few years back CRA send a assessment letter for her moving expenses, and it turned out that she under-reported the expenses, leading to CRA even refunding her more after that, probably increasing her credibility in eye of CRA (if there is such a thing)).",2023-05-22 12:29:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/13opjss/incorrect_cost_basis_leading_to_tax_saving/

No T4 from Dead Company,2,"Hi, I worked for my dad who had a sole proprietorship. He died a year ago and his business was behind on taxes and all accounting. 

I know what my earnings were for that year for net payments. I have gone through the PRD online to calculate what my gross income was. There is no T4 and the payments to me were done by e-transfer from his business bank account. 

When he died, I don’t know what the procedure is about this T4. I know his other business owed a lot of money to the CRA and I think there is a lien against the assets of his estate. 

I’m assuming that he didn’t pay the CRA for my last year of deductions. I can’t find any evidence that he did.

I want to do this the right way. Obviously the taxes need to be paid and filed. The money I got as wages should have had proper deductions taken. Getting an accountant isn’t something I can afford and due to inheritance drama I can’t access any of the company records.

"[ LONG POST ] [ HELP NEEDED ] -- Beginner small business owner, I've messed up my first payroll and T4 filing. Need help to calculate gross pay and payroll source deductions.",5,"Hello everyone,

I come to you with my tail between my legs, feeling like an idiot over this.

I started a small corporation last year. I am the sole employee, and owner.

At the end of 2022, around December 30th, I paid myself (as a person) from my corporation, with two payments of $5000 CAD. This was my only payroll for the year.

***$10 000.00 CAD ended up in my personal bank account, meaning my NET pay as an INDIVIDUAL was 10K.***

My mistake was that I forgot to do any source deductions, and now, I'm having a very hard time figuring it out. The source deductions are all based on the gross pay, but I don't have a gross pay, I only know the net pay, 10K.

I have tried my very best to do the math and follow the online guides, but I keep getting a different answer every time. Online calculators don't work, either, as the ones provided by the CRA don't allow for once-per-year pay intervals, and the one calculator I found that does, from Quickbooks, has given me two different answers the two times I used it -- undoubtedly because I did something wrong.

I'm really hoping someone can help calculate this for me.

# Here's the relevant information:

* Amount of money sent from the corporation to my personal bank account: $10 000.00 CAD
* Total amount of money made as an individual (what I reported on my taxes as my net income): $10 000.00 CAD

# The payroll deductions I need to calculate:

* Income Tax
* CPP (Canadian Pension Plan)
* ~~EI (Employment Insurance)~~  ***I am EI-exempt, and do not need to deduct or remit EI.***

&#x200B;

# CPP Deductions:

""You have to deduct CPP contributions from your employee's pensionable earnings. As an employer, you must contribute an **amount equal** to the CPP contributions that you deduct from your employees' remuneration. You will continue to do so under the CPP enhancement.""

|Year|**Maximum annual pensionable earnings**|**Basic exemption amount**|**Maximum contributory earnings**|**Employee and employer contribution rate (%)**|**Maximum annual employee and employer contribution**|**Maximum annual** **self-employed** **contribution**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022|$66,600|$3,500|$63,100|5.95|$3,754.45|$7,508.90|

&#x200B;

# Income Tax:

Applicable Federal Tax rate for Income less than 50K: 15%

Applicable Provincial Tax rate for Income less than 46000: 5.05%

(Total 20.05%)

&#x200B;

# My Understanding:

My understanding is that

    Net Pay = Gross Pay - Income Tax - CPP
     10,000 = Gross Pay - Income Tax - CPP
            = Gross Pay - (Gross Pay * 20.05%) - CPP
            = Gross Pay - (Gross Pay * 20.05%) - (Employee CPP + Employer CPP)
    
    where Employee CPP = Employer CPP, therefore
    
            = Gross Pay - (Gross Pay * 20.05%) - (2*Employee CPP)
    
    where CPP = ( Gross Pay - 3500 )*5.95%, therefore
    
            = Gross Pay - 0.2005*Gross Pay - (2*((Gross Pay - 3500)*5.95%))
            = Gross Pay - 0.2005*Gross Pay - (2*(0.0595*Gross Pay - 208.25))
            = Gross Pay - 0.2005*Gross Pay - (0.119*Gross Pay - 416.5)
    
    Therefore,
    
     10,000 = 0.6805*Gross Pay - 416.5
     10,416.5 = 0.6805*Gross Pay
    10,416.5 / 0.6805 = Gross Pay
    
    Therefore,
    
    Gross Pay = 15 307.12

Is that correct? Or did I make a mistake by including both the employee CPP and employer CPP? Is it supposed to be only the employee CPP counts towards what the gross pay was, and then the employer CPP portion is just something that comes into play for the corporate tax return, but not for the employee T4?

Because if that's the case, the math changes to

          = Gross Pay - 0.2005*Gross Pay - (0.0595*Gross Pay - 208.25)
    
    Which works out to
    
    10,208.25 = 0.74*Gross Pay
    
    Gross Pay = 13,794.93

Bank exchange rate MINUS CRA exchange rate as a business expense?,0,"I might be grasping at straws here, but I'm curious about 
whether I can declare the difference between a bank exchange rate and the CRA exchange rate as a business expense.

I use VBCE for a great exchange rate, but it will always be slightly above the international or CRA exchange rate. Could I use the difference as an expense for the company?

Should I keep this US property?,0,"Cross posted with the US side!


Hi tax experts!

I need your advice!

I bought a $1.4m triplex in 2020 that I’ve lived in for 2 years to get principal residency exemption (I’ve moved out). I got a low interest rate so I thankfully cash flow $4000 per month on the property.

I’m a single filer.

I am moving back to Canada in December. I’m a Canadian citizen. Ideally I’d love to keep the property for the cash flow if gives me but unsure how to structure my thoughts on the tax implications. As a non resident do I owe more taxes?

Also I lived in one of the units during my residency. Because it’s a triplex does IRS only take 1/3 of the $250k cap gain exemption?

If I end up holding it for a few more years while In Canada and then sell it, would that be more advantageous?

Error on TD1,5,"I’m looking for some advice about an error I made on a TD1 form for a new job. I just started a new job at a restaurant, and filled out my TD1 form the same way I usually would. However, I completely forgot that I technically have two employers, and would have already filled out another form already this year. Basically, I’m technically employed as a supply teacher with my local school board, but did it for 4 days earlier in the year and decided it wasn’t for me, so I stopped. However, legally speaking I am still employed with them. I don’t really intend to supply teach again this year, but it’s not a door I’ve totally closed yet.

The form reads: “If you have more than one employer or payer at the same time and you have already claimed personal tax credit amounts on another Form TD1 for 2023, you cannot claim them again. If your total income from all sources will be more than the personal tax credits you claimed on another Form TD1, check this box, enter ""0"" on Line 13 and do not fill in Lines 2 to 12”

Spicy Albertan Tax Question,5,"Hi everyone,

I've been out of work since March, and the job hunt has been frustrating and unsuccessful so far. As such, I've decided to try out online sex work. Unfortunately, my (Albertan) city's bylaws are draconian about what types of businesses are allowed. Most small businesses, including sex work, are out of the question. This would force me to fly under the radar locally, and it's making me a bit nervous because I'm usually very by-the-book. I still plan on reporting any income on my federal returns -I want to do the right thing and pay my share as much as the circumstances will allow. My questions are as follows:

&#x200B;

1. How likely is it that the information I provide on my federal tax returns would be shared with the local taxman? I tried reading about this on the government website, but I couldn't make sense of what constitutes 'just cause' for the sharing of tax info between govt. bodies.
2. If I have to register a GST number (needed for sales over 30k/year), would that be brought to the city's attention? What about a sole proprietorship? If I were to get caught, would I be on the hook for anything other than not registering a small business?

Any relevant experience/advice is very much appreciated.

Question about charging HST,4,"Hi all! The folks over at r/PersonalFinanceCanada sent me this way, so I'm hoping I can get some perspective on our situation! The normal accountant we use hasn't been able to track down and give a confident answer on this. (Admittedly, also a friend of ours who mainly sticks to personal income tax stuff)

So my partner started a mental health / therapy practice last year. She's an MSW and is therefore exempt from charging HST. She also has a couple independent contractors that work for her on a very part-time basis who are also MSWs and therefore don't charge HST. My partner collects the appointment fee, and disburses the payout per appointment to the independent contractors.

However, a psycho-therapist wants to join who are not exempt from charging HST. My question is, does my partner need to pay the HST because she's collecting the fee upfront before disbursing the remaining money to the psycho-therapist? Or because the psycho-therapist is an independent contractor, would we process the payment the same as we do the MSW contractors, and the psycho-therapist would then do the HST on their end? I'm leaning towards the latter but unsure.

As a total aside and unrelated question, we've found that we want to register for an HST number regardless because we'd get HST back on our purchases for the practice. Having said that...it doesn't seem fair to the government if we're paying little to no HST on our services to be able to get HST back on things like rent, purchases of furniture, etc. If anyone has run into this dilemma, I'd love to hear your thoughts on it as well.

"Transfer tuition, education, textbook amount",4,"My son started college in September last year. He is a full-time student and doesn't/did not work. I'm looking to transfer any unused tuition, education, and textbook amounts to myself. He went to a free community tax preparer and they've already filed his taxes. I haven't filed mine mainly because I don't know how to do the transfer.

When he went to the tax preparer, he gave them his T2202 Tuition and Enrollment Certificate. The tax preparer used the amounts there in his return. Now in his 2022 Assessment (from the CRA website) there's a Federal Tuition, Education and Textbook Amounts - Schedule11 listed. There's an amount in Line 32000 Eligible tuition and fees paid to Canadian educational institutions and Line 32020 Education and textbook amounts according to number of months from column C of Forms T2202, T2202A, TL11A,and TL11C.

I've researched this and know that in the back of the T2202, there's a part that needs to be filled out to transfer unused current amounts. I believe he needs to fill it in to transfer the credits to me.

Do I just copy the amount on his Schedule 11 32000 and 32020 and is the sum of that the amount I can claim on my own return as the amount of tuition transferred to me?",2023-05-18 14:23:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/13l0jgp/transfer_tuition_education_textbook_amount/

Transferring RRSP account to another institution,4,"Hi all, 

I'm thinking of transferring my RRSP mutual fund account to another institution. Reason being the high administrative fees of the mutual fund and its poor performance. 

The objective of my transfer is to put the funds in an Index ETF that tracks the market with little overseeing on my part but charges a fraction of the administrative  cost that the mutual fund would.

I think that I would need to transfer the account in cash rather than kind since I would be purchasing an ETF rather than the same basket of mutual funds in the new brokerage. 

My questions are:
1) What are the tax implications of such a transfer?
2) Will the transfer affect my RRSP ceiling?
3) When I liquidate  the mutual fund from my old institution will there be any tax to be paid since I will be transferring  the funds in the rrsp account  in cash rather than kind to the new brokerage?

"Does a ""long-resident visitor"" need to file prior year returns after being granted a work permit?",1,"Someone asked me to help her file tax returns in Canada after getting a work permit. The question is whether she needs to file taxes ever since she entered Canada.

She entered with her daughter (a minor) on a visitor visa on 2020/01/09 from China. Her daughter has a study permit to attend elementary school in Canada. Ever since the 2 of them entered, they had only left for a trip to Mexico in 2022 that lasted for 5 days. She received a work permit on 2022/09/15.

Are we supposed to assume that she became a resident of Canada for tax purposes on 2020/01/09 when she entered? Are we then supposed to file her taxes starting from 2020, then 2021, then 2022 even though she did not have a Social Insurance Number until she got a work permit, and had to report her worldwide income (that certainly includes income from China)?

How flexible is CRA with payment plans?,4,"Let me start by saying I had no idea how taxes work, and have worked myself into a corner. 

In the past there were years where I would owe some money, and then the next year's return would have a refund and take care of it and everyone was happy... I thought that was how it worked.

But over the past few years and making some mistakes (taking CERB when I was laid off during COVID, withdrawing RRSPs for a downpayment for a house incorrectly) I now owe them about $7000. 

I got a collection letter last summer, and after playing phone tag with my rep for weeks and never really getting anywhere I just started putting random amounts of money towards it every payday. The phone calls stopped, and I assumed they were happy with the arrangement.

Then I got another collection letter, more phone tag with the rep (with one conversation) and then they went on strike.
On our phone call rep made it very clear if we didn't set something up by a certain date (I think the first Friday they were on strike, but I don't remember the date) they would take all legal action to get the funds. But rep was on strike so I couldn't talk to them. The CRA website let me setup a payment plan for paying it off over 2 years... Again, I assumed we were good.

Now the rep is calling again and we did actually have a conversation and did a ""budget analysis"" and they want essentially 3X the two year plan I agreed to online. We could do that and live for sure, but wrecks things like Christmas and kids birthdays and anniversaries and such for sure.

Does anyone know how much flexibility the reps actually have in regards to their demands? I agree I need to pay, and have every intention of paying. I'm just hoping to spread out a little bit more than they are demanding.

How to handle taxes and ACB as self employment with USD payments,2,"I'm a self employed person, working remotely with a US company. Being paid in US dollars. Working with one company only. How exactly I should file my taxes for this income?

Example: I am being paid monthly, $10k usd. I don't convert this to CAD right away. At the end of the year do I just use average annual rate from Bank of Canada to report that my income was $120k \* Exchange rate? Or should I keep the records against the daily rate as soon as the usd hits my account and sum it all up come reporting time?

Also, how should I track the ACB? Just like any given stock? Should I use a daily rate for Exchange or annual rate whenever I convert to CAD?

We are using Wise to transfer the payments for the work. The bank account doesn't seem to be a Canadian one, because I can see IBAN number which I usually don't see in our banks. If I keep more than 100k CAD in that wise account for the whole year, do I have to submit 1135 form as well as T2125?

I started working in this remote setup fairly recently, but looks like I need to register for HST number even though I'm providing the services for non Canadian entity? Do I wait until I pass the 30k threshold (which would be reached next month) or can I do that now already? Would having HST number help me deduct expenses (like working from home and deducing portion of my rent, portion of internet bill, etc)?

The dividend myth,0,"Growing up, I was always told by my mother and others that when you invest, make sure you get paid in dividends, especially qualified ones. As somehow (magically) you don't pay as much taxes as most other forms of income.

&#x200B;

A while back, I did a course through H&R that mentioned something similar. That dividends are not taxed as much as most other sources of income.

&#x200B;

However, there is a catch. The reason for this, is due to the dividend tax credit. 

&#x200B;

But a caveat to this, is that the only reason you get the credit, is because the company has already paid full tax on the dividend it paid you. The reason for the credit is to prevent unfair double-taxation.

&#x200B;

Now think on this for a moment. That company is YOUR company. You purchased shares into it to become a part-owner of it. So YOU already paid tax on the dividend BEFORE the dividend arrived to you, which you re-calc things all over again.

&#x200B;

So is it really saving on taxes when you invest in dividends? This seems to be a washout.

"Corporate T2 - ""Total assets do not equal total liabilities and equity”",5,"Hey everybody,

Here is the situation. I'm doing my own corporate taxes for a small online business. I have completed both schedule 100 and 125, and I am unable to balance the balance sheet. My assets are about $200 less than my liabilities+equity.

I have spent many grueling hours digging through bills and statements and cannot find where this missing $200 could be from. 

I'm wondering if I can just simply add the $200 to my assets, take note of it, and call it a day. I realized that it would not affect the profit I report and thus would not affect the taxes I pay. 

Anybody know if CRA would have a problem with this if I was audited?

Tax implications for US citizen working remotely for US company temporarily in Canada,7,"Hi, I am a US citizen that currently resides in the United States and I am getting married later this year to a Canadian citizen.

Amending 2021 and 2022 Tax Return using myCRA- Adding the work from home benefit using form T777S E.,3,"For a little background, I worked remotely in 2021 and 2022 remotely. I hastily used the app called CloudTax to do my taxes. I didn't claim the Work from Home Benefit, so I am now retroactively amending my 2021 and 2022 return to include the benefit. 

 I am using the Temporary Flat Rate Method to calculate the credit for line 22900 for both my 2021 and 2022 tax return. I worked mostly remote due to COVID. I am claiming 500$ for both 2021 and 2022 since I worked at least part of the day for 250 days a year for both those years. My first question is regarding whether working at least part of the day from home will consist as working from home, as some days I would travel from home to client sites. If possible, please advise. Secondly, my last question is submitting the  T777S E form. On the CRA's website, it says the form must be submitted with my tax return. However, when amending my return for both 2022 and 2021, I cannot find a place in the myCRA website to submit the T777S E form. Do I simply modify the return with the credit claimed on line 22900 and hold on to the T777 E form for both 2022 and 2021 in case the CRA asks for supporting documentation?  I appreciate any advice.

Paid taxes on time but filed late - late filing fee?,9,"I am a T1 filer as I am a self-employed professional. Due to circumstances unforeseen involving my accountant, I realized that I was not going to be able to file my 2021 income tax return on time. 

In light of this, I paid what I correctly estimated to be my balance owing for 2021 (in fact, I overpaid substantially), on April 28, 2022. Admittedly, I did not rush to file my 2021 income tax return as I was under the impression that, since I had already paid my balance owing, I would not incur any fees.

I finally filed my 2021 income tax return two weeks ago, and the CRA is demanding a late filing fee despite the fact that I paid my 2021 balancing owing, on time, in 2022. 

They are taking the position that since my 2021 tax return is showing a ""balance owing"", it does not matter whether I had paid in advance - as they go off of whatever is shown on my income tax return. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Should my CPA have reported the amount paid in my 2021 income tax return? Would I have any chance at having this reversed if I seek forgiveness or if I file a dispute?

So, my question is, is it compulsory to pay cra in advance ? And is there any interest penalty if I don't pay the quarterly instalments and directly pay a lump sum after filing my taxes in 2024.

Husband missed notice of reassessment,10,"In 2021, we had to move to a new city as my husband got a job in his desired field. We kept our moving receipts and had his employer write a letter, and deducted the travel/moving expenses from his taxes, filed on time in 2022. We file jointly (I do most of the tax work) but I never became his representative - he managed his CRA account and I managed mine. 

I went online today after filing this year’s tax returns to check out NOA statuses - because he was busy, he gave me his login and I checked his for him. I saw that he had a substantial amount owing since December, so I looked further. 

Apparently, the CRA notified him that they were looking into his taxes in August of 2022 and asked for receipts, the letter, etc. My husband said he got a couple of emails from them but said he thought it was for his business account (he had a short-lived sole proprietorship), which he checked but didn’t think to check his personal account. We checked his email - he got an email in August that he had mail, and another in November, both of which would have required him to sign in to his CRA account to read. We never got anything through Canada Post. 

This is clearly his fault. It was a huge mistake, thinking it was for his business when it was his personal account. That being said, I’m calling in on Monday and hoping to apply for an extension as it’s within the year since the first notice. I just don’t want to get my hopes up.

What are the chances of being granted an extension on these grounds? We’ve authorized myself as his representative tonight and I’m taking over from here, but how far will “he got really confused between his business and personal accounts” get us? 

(I’m trying to cut him some slack, it’s been an awful year for both of us as I’ve struggled with a serious medical condition. It’s just very frustrating.)",2023-05-07 06:51:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/13afmmc/husband_missed_notice_of_reassessment/

It's a very simple return. Im getting an error trying to netfile saying I need to remove the EI overpayment amount for repayment as it is greater than 3 years old. The amount is < $20. Studio Tax won't let me remove the line item manually without removing the amount from box 18. It says if I cant remove it I need to paper file. I guess my questions are:

Can superficial losses exist on put options like they do on call options?,3,"I understand that call options on the same underlier with different strike prices and expiration dates are subject to superficial loss rules - so I can't sell calls at a loss, then immediately purchase a different call on the underlier and realize a capital loss on the first option holding. The capital loss (or at least a portion) would be disallowed and added to the cost base of the second option.

Does this apply to puts in the same way? The language says:

*You, or a person* *affiliated* *with you, buys, or has a right to buy, the same or identical property (called ""substituted property"") during the period starting 30 calendar days before the sale and ending 30 calendar days after the sale*

My confusion comes from uncertainty on whether calls on the same underlier with different strikes and expiration dates are considered ""identical property"" (in which case it would seem like superficial losses **would** exist for puts), or are they subject because they are ""the right to buy identical property"" - i.e. the underlying stock - in which case puts would not be eligible since they are not the right to **buy**?

Claiming repayments of owed taxes from previous years,4,"Hi, I know very little about filing taxes.

Claiming principal residence exemption on assignment sale,4,"Hi everyone, I'm posting this on behalf of a friend. He purchased a preconstruction in 2018 with his then long-term girlfriend. In January 2022 they moved in during the occupancy period. In the summer of 2022 they broke up, and in October 2022 they sold the condo on assignment.   


He just filed his taxes, and the advice that he received from his accountant (who indicated he consulted with a tax lawyer) is that he is eligible for the principal residence exemption given it was his intent to live in the unit as his principal residence at time of purchase, and only sold the unit due to a breakdown of his relationship. 

My understanding is that because he did not take official possession/close on the property, CRA will not grant him the PRE. I think he's being given the wrong information, but I'm not an accountant or a tax lawyer. I'm worried he'll get audited and end up paying penalties if he's filing his taxes off of the wrong advice.

GST/HST rules when selling to resellers...,1,"I honestly don't know why I am having so much trouble finding this information online and even ChatGPT gave me a vague answer that wasn't much help. The CRA's website doesn't make anything any clearer.

I am in Ontario and almost all of my customers are resellers with their own GST or PST accounts with the CRA or provincial governments. I am fairly certain that the GST portion (5%) always has to be charged and the my customers can recover that with input tax credits, but I am completely confused when it comes to sorting out provincial rules.

I used to live and work in the US, and there, it's really simple: if you have a resale certificate from your customer, you simply don't charge sales tax. Here, there's already this hybrid model which is really confusing between the federal and provincial governments - some participate in HST, some don't, and everyone seems to have their own way of doing it.

I was able some time ago to get in touch with someone in the BC government who confirmed for me that as long as the reseller is registered in BC for PST, I do not need to charge their PST. So, I at least have BC down, and Alberta is easy since there's no provincial sales tax. However, what about every other province? What about for the combined HST provinces?

I tried calling the CRA for help today, but of course because of the strike, all hotlines are down. Does anyone have any guidance here on how to proceed?

"CRA froze accounts and are unreachable, now what?",0,"The CRA has been sending increasingly urgent messages about a disputed amount from a few years back. I hadn’t adequately prioritized this because the amount was paid and it’s an administrative error, but then I came home from a work trip to find all of my accounts frozen and all money sucked out of each of my accounts. Yikes!

So obviously I want to fix this as quickly as possible. I have sufficient funds to cover it in my US bank from before I moved to Canada. But seems I’m in a catch-22:

- The Canadian bank won’t unfreeze things without word from CRA.

- CRA is unreachable due to the strike and the fact that it’s high tax season — have tried both the main #s and the #s of the agent indicated in the RTP, multiple times.

- I can’t wire the funds to my frozen accounts in order to transfer it to CRA, because there’s no way to move it from there; any amounts are immediately confiscated.

- I can’t wire funds to my alternate Canadian bank (Tangerine) because they don’t accept wire transfers. :(

- There is a wire transfer destination listed for the receiver general on the payment site, but it says that’s only for non-residents.

Calculating Capital gain/loss - does this seem correct?,1,"Hi all,

First time reporting capital gain/tax from my company stock.

I don't have T5 because it's not a Canadian stock. That said, all the numbers here is in CAD.

My question is:

1. Is it correct to use ACB on the day of the Sell transactions? Using this method, I suddenly have -341.58 Capital loss which i wasn't expecting.
2. When I plug these numbers in Wealthsimple tax, is this a correct way to do it?

Here's the breakdown.

2022-12-12 SELL:

* Proceeds for selling 7.0812 shares = 1039.23691 (146.76 X 7.0812)
* ACB for selling 7.0812 shares = 974.514744 CAD (7.0812 X 137.62 ( Used ACB on 2022-12-12) )
* Fee was 3.12 CAD
* Gain : 61.59 CAD

2022-09-13 SELL:

* Proceeds for selling 14.5966 shares = 1676.56548 (114.86 X 14.5966)
* ACB for selling 14.5966 shares = 2012.87114 CAD (14.5966 X 137.90 (Used ACB on 2022-09-13) )
* Fee was 5.03 CAD
* Loss: -341.38 CAD

I'd really appreciate it, thanks.

Messed up my T1135. Refile? VDP?,1,"Hi :

I submitted the 1135 this morning and rejoiced that I was done for another year. Then later in the day, I finally clued in to what was meant by ""The maximum cost ... must not be less than the ... year-end"".

It is a non-resident trust containing just cash that has been accruing interest. To do the max and year end, I have been converting the outstanding foreign balance to CAD instead of converting each individual transaction and then calculating the ongoing CAD balance. This is what I should have been isn't it?

Is it possible to refile and so replace my 2022 T1135 online before the deadline? If so, how?

What about previous years? VDP request? I feel a headache coming on.

Do I have to claim CCA expense on my rental income?,2,"Hello folks, I own and rent out an apartment in BC. I pay $200 in monthly instalments to the CRA to cover the tax portion on my rental income.

I attached a T776 with my T1 to claim the income earned and expenses paid, however, I intentionally did not claim CCA (depreciation expense). The reason is that I don't want to recapture all of my CCA when I sell my apartment and pay back all the taxes I saved during the years I claimed my CCA. That would be quite burdening on me.

"T4PS, tax deduction not appearing on any documents?",1,"I received an ""Incentive Bonus"" (as profit sharing) of $10,000 from my employer. My pay stub for the period this was deposited shows I earned the $10k as income. It also shows ~$3k in tax being withheld in addition to the amount normally withheld for my salaried income. Net result of the bonus is $7k being deposited into my bank account.

I'm going to use simplified numbers, but here is the gist of my problem:

* my final paystub for the year shows I earned $110k (100 salary + 10 bonus) and paid $35k (32 salary + 3 bonus) in taxes
* my T4 only shows the $100k salary earned and $32k tax withheld
* my T4PS shows the $10k bonus earned
* neither I nor the CRA (in my portal) received any documents from my employer showing that tax was withheld for the bonus

The result is, when I fill out my return it says I *owe* $3k. **How do I prove that I've already paid the tax on my bonus?** Am I missing a tax document?

I've sent out an email with this question to my employer and am in a queue with the CRA. In the meantime, I was hoping to get clarity from this subreddit because googling for T4PS tax is no help.

"Sole proprietorship, does it matter under whose name ?",1,"Hello everyone, I’m looking for an answer for something that’s been puzzling me.

My spouse and I are in Canada and have a YouTube channel, a sole proprietorship under her name, we both worked on it in the first year but didn’t use split income, it also didn’t matter under whose name the channel is or to whose bank account the money is being deposited.

Last year, I was solely doing all the work except for the narration, everything remained the same.

When we did the taxes last year, we claimed the channel’s income under her name which put her in a different income bracket and hence ended up paying a higher amount owing.

Can I now claim the income under my name despite the fact that we didn’t change ownership and the income is still being deposited into her account ?

T4 that displays foreign income,2,"Hi all, have a question to clarify something. My wife works for the US government and is a US citizen, but is a permanent resident of Canada, and works as a locally employed staff member.

The US considers this American, and not foreign (ie Canadian) income, as it turns out, so her income does not qualify for the US Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. We received a letter from the IRS letting us know of this for her return from 2020, so we paid taxes to the wrong country, essentially. So we need to send them the tax equivalent, but we also obviously need to amend her 2020 Canadian return too with the foreign tax credit to get that amount back from the Canadian government.

Here's where my question comes in. She received a T4 AND a W2 from her employer, and they both have the income on them, and the T4 has the other usual items like CPP and EI contributions, as well as RPP contribution and pension adjustment. Her return that year was obviously filed with the T4 she was given. T4s are, I would think, implied to be solely Canadian income (but maybe not?). So if her entire income needs to now be considered 'foreign' from that year, what do I do with the T4 already there? Do I leave it be and just fill out the T2209? Or do I also have to remove the T4 entirely as this is not Canadian income anymore? But then what about accounting for the CPP, EI, and the RPP contributions? Would I have to find another way to document those items?

There's also line 10400 where I know you're supposed to put other employment income, which includes foreign. But I filled out the T2209 in Studiotax and it didn't automatically fill in 10400 with anything, but it DID reduce the balance owing accordingly, and it's usually pretty good about auto-filling things in correctly.

So basically what I'm asking is, between the existing T4, the T2209, and line 10400, what needs to be included?

&#x200B;

EDIT: We spoke to the IRS rep assigned to our case and she explained that we shouldn't have to claim it as foreign on the Canadian returns, but to claim the foreign tax credit on the US return instead. So that basically solves that! Thanks to those who responded already though.",2023-05-01 13:28:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/134mhyb/t4_that_displays_foreign_income/

Income Property Interest,1,"Good evening,

Got a question and I'll use John as my example.

John bought a property in 2010 for $300,000 and had a $200,000 mortgage.

John got married and in 2015 after his term was up on his mortgage he refinanced his mortgage from $170,000 to $220,000 (took out $50,000) and used it as a lumpsum payment for his primary residence and rented out his original property as a rental.

John is filing his tax in 2020 (any any year there after the previous event) and is wondering how he calculates the interest deduction when filing his taxes for his rental property?

My understanding is that John cannot claim interest as a deduction on his rental property for the $50,000 refinanced amount as it was used toward his primary residence, but can on the $170,000.",2023-05-01 00:59:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/1348dkt/income_property_interest/

CRA has a different Fed tax and Provincial tax vs WS Tax.,1,"I’m sorry for my ignorance. But i’m hoping to get your insight on this. My wife and I filed using WS tax. We did a combined filing and WS tax shows that we both owe 500cad each. 

We then filed this to CRA. After this, my wife logged in to her CRA account and it shows she owes 500cad so she paid for it. I then logged in to my CRA account and was shocked that it says I owe 3.2Kcad. I reviewed my statement and the difference is in line 42000 Fed tax and 42800 prov tax. CRA shows a insanely bigger amount compared to WS tax.

Has someone experienced this? My wife has no issues and matches what we filled using WS, but mine shows different amount in CRA.

I plan on calling CRA tomorrow to inquire, but worried if no one will answer due to strike. I am just not sure if this is a glitch or how to fix this. I can’t pay 3.2K i’m not even a high earner.

Calculating taxes on RRSP withdrawal,1,"Hi folks. I live in Ontario. I’m trying to do the math the taxes I’d be saving with RRSP contributions, and the taxes I’d be paying later on that money in retirement.

Assuming my gross family income is $190,650, and I contribute $13,000 in RRSPs. That bumps my taxable income down $13k to $177,650.

I would have been taxed a combined Ontario and Federal tax rate of 48.29% on the first $6319.96 of that 13k (that’s what’s left in that tax bracket) and 49.85% on the last $6680.04 of the 13k.
That’s $6381.91 in taxes that I’d be paying on that last $13k if I didn’t contribute to it to an RRSP. Right?

So, fast forward to retirement. Let’s say our income is about 70% of what it was (let’s just say $140,000).

When I pull that $13k as part of my income that year, what should I consider to be its tax rate in my calculations? It’s part of my broader income that year, and won’t be the only money pulled out of an RRSP that year.

E.g. Should I consider it:
1. The last $13k of my income that year (taxed at 43.41%)? 
2. A weighted avg tax rate for my whole income that year (27.89%)?
3. Something else?

Filed my T2125 before my T4 And Now I cannot submit by T4????,0,"I did some brief self employed work last year and earned about $500. So I filled out a T2125 and submitted that. 

But when I tried to then submit my T4, Turbotax is telling me that I've already submitted my return so I cannot submit my T4 now, which is my MAIN FORM because it contains the majority of my income AND my tuition credits.

I've been told that I now have to wait for my notice of assessment before I can file.

But the huge problem with this is that for most cases, its for people who have already filed their T4 and have just made a few minor errors that need to be corrected. In my case I have not even submitted the T4!!! This is a huge ERROR! The entire document isn't there.

Amend before or after notice of assessment?,3,"Hi all,

I have not yet received my 2021 notice of assessment. This was also my first Canadian tax return, so I do not have access to My Account, because you can only access it after your first NOA (urg).

Anyway, I have realized that I have forgotten to include some deductions (partially my accountant's fault...). Is it better to send a paper T1-ADJ form now, or wait until I get my NOA and then amend online using my account?

"I haven't filed my taxes for four years because of low income amounts, just wanted to ask if there's a financially optimal approach to take when I file them all at once this year?",3,"I foolishly avoided filing my taxes for the past four years because I have made well under the maximum basic personal amount (BPA) allowed for each of those years. I made between $8000 and $12,000 in each of the last four tax years. I made the money by working freelance jobs, so I will be filing as self employed. 

I'd like to file my taxes for this past year and for the three years before that just to get some of the credits and benefits that I've missed out on and to contribute to the Canada Pension Plan, etc.

I'm not clear on how CPP contributions are deducted from self employed individuals (who are supposed to pay both the employee and employer side of CPP, or around 11.4% of their income for 2022) when their income is well under the maximum BPA they can claim, which is $14,398 federally, for the 2022 tax year. 

Is that 11.4% CPP amount still automatically contributed in your name but then covered by the government when people have an income of less than the full BPA credit?  Is it calculated only on amounts above the $3,500 minimum income amount needed before CPP contributions become compulsory?

Or do you forfeit all CPP contributions when you claim the maximum BPA tax credit while posting an income that's less than that amount for that tax year?

Same question applies for EI premiums for self-employed individuals who would like to contribute a portion of their taxes to EI through the EI special benefits program. If eligible (and after the 12 month waiting period), will the CRA just deduct the $1.63 in EI premiums for every $100 I've earned as long as the minimum eligibility net income of $8,255 for the 2022 tax year is claimed? 

I've read over the CRA's article on this [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-self-employed-workers.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-self-employed-workers.html), but I'm still unsure of how this all works with people who make less than the basic personal amount.

Lastly, is there anything I should keep in mind to avoid potential conflicts with the credit and benefit amounts I may be entitled to when submitting three years of back taxes along with my current year's tax forms? All that I know so far is that it's best to submit them in chronological order.

In the past, I have never seen or been charged ""arrears interest"" unless I missed a (tax paid by) instalment payment.  I confirmed CRA has received all my instalments by the due date and I have no outstanding instalments (until June). 

I went ahead and paid the entire amount including the arrears interest electronically with my bank.  My ""actual"" Notice of Assessment will be available by May 9 and CRA says I must pay the entire amount by the end of May to avoid [further] interest, which I did.

CPA #1 miscalculated my RRSP contributions

Turbo tax live assist seem to be using the wrong value to calculate my foreign tax credit.

I paid roughly $7,800 CAD to UK HMRC on my income from sold property.

**QUESTION :**

On the **T2209** which value should I use for Net Foreign Income :

**Option 1** : Value on my T1135 E $43K <- This is the total profit made from the sale of my property after costs

**Option 2** : 50% of option 1 $21.5K because this is the value that is used in the CGT calculation.... This doesn't make any sense to me but is what the Turbo tax advisor is insisting.

(The CPA who miscalculated my RRSP slips was using Option 1)

If I use Option 1 : The foreign tax credit is $7,698.98 and close to what I paid to the UK HMRC - this seems right to me.

If I used Option 2 : The foreign tax credit is $3,849 49

Is it possible to reduce tax from interest/dividends using capital loss?,1,"Hi everyone,

Is it possible to reduce tax from interest/dividends using capital loss from other investments?

Specifically, I have some capital loss reported on T5008 and have both interest and dividends from other investments.

Turbotax doesn't pick this up automatically - it only offsets the gains from T5008, but even after that I have capital loss and have to pay tax on interest/dividends from other sources - is there any possibility to reduce that?

My understanding is that it's not possible, as capital loss can only be used to reduce tax from capital gains and dividends/interest are a different type of income - is that correct?

The page just tells me to call the toll-free number but none of the options on the phone help me, and there's absolutely no way to talk to anyone, once again, probably because of the strike.

Urgent: Seeking Advice on GST/HST Overpayment Situation - Lost Faith in My Accountant,0,"Hello Reddit community,

I am reaching out for some advice and insight on a tax issue I am currently facing with my Canadian corporation. Due to several oversights by my current accounting team, I have lost all faith in their ability to manage my corporation's tax matters, and I am in the process of switching to a new team. Before I do that, I wanted to get some input from the knowledgeable folks here.

Here's a brief summary of the situation:

My corporation provides services to firms in the tech and SaaS space, with clients in different countries. Due to an error by my accounting team, we have mistakenly remitted over $13,000 in GST/HST from the revenue received from one of our international clients (based in Australia). I recently learned that the services provided to this client should be considered ""zero-rated"" for GST/HST purposes, and we should not have collected or remitted any GST/HST on the payments received from them.

I need some advice on how to rectify this situation, specifically:

1. What is the appropriate process to request a refund for the overpaid GST/HST from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)?
2. Are there any specific documentation or forms we need to prepare and submit for this purpose?
3. Are there any time limits or deadlines we need to be aware of for requesting a refund for previous periods?

I understand that the advice given here may not replace professional consultation, but any general guidance or insight from the Reddit community would be greatly appreciated. I want to be better informed before I engage with a new accounting team to address this issue.

Thank you in advance for your help!

"Self-Employed Gig Worker & Automobile Deductions, Possible Method of Using Per-KM Rate",0,"Hi, I’m curious if I’m missing anything here, or if this would be a viable method as a gig worker to take higher automobile tax deductions.

This pertains to delivery/ride-share drivers. Ex. Doordash, Uber, SkipTheDishes, etc.

Since workers are considered self-employed, vehicle deductions are pretty straightforward on a personal tax return. Log your vehicle usage, get a proportional rate for business use vs. total use, and use that to determine what percentage of annual vehicle expenses (gas, mechanic, etc.) can be deducted. Also use it for CCA depreciation.

Sole proprietors must use that method, unlike the USA where they can use a flat per-mile deduction. However, in Canada, there is a set “reasonable” per-km rate for employers paying out automobile allowances to employees. [This is currently $0.68/km ($0.62/km over 5,000 km)](https://www.taxtips.ca/smallbusiness/tax-free-vehicle-allowance.htm), which let’s be honest, if you’re doing gig work in a cheap and efficient car, your actual deductions aren’t going to be that high.

So, it would be great if a gig worker could deduct a flat $0.62-0.68/km rather than actual expenses. But of course, as we know, you cannot.

Unless, could you not simply do the following?:

Set up a corporation. Have Uber/Skip/etc pay that corporation. Make yourself an employee of that corporation. Now, you can simply pay yourself (the employee) an automobile allowance from the corporation at the set “reasonable” rate, based on your kilometres driven. That payment is tax-deductible for the corporation, and tax-free for the employee. The rest of the corporation’s earnings can be paid to yourself as a salary, dividends, whatever. But the main point is, it would seem that you are now able to fully deduct the set per-km rate from your earnings using this method. Am I missing something?",2023-04-27 21:11:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/13175ck/selfemployed_gig_worker_automobile_deductions/
Senior's kitchen renovations- senior's home safety tax credit?,1,"My parents have done a kitchen renovation in 2022 which included replacement of floor, changing light fixtures from some old ones to pot lights and removing and installing a new kitchen which gave them more accessibility in terms of countertops, lever handles, and easier cabinet door closures.

My mom isn't 65 yet but my dad is over 65. Can he claim the Senior's home safety tax credit?

Full-time babysitter—self-employed or not?,1,"Hello, if a person is making a living as a babysitter but working for various different families, are they considered an employee of the families or a self-employed individual.

I've looked into the CRA definitions and it almost sounds like they would be considered an employee. However, it also seems overly burdensome and onerous for each family that is using the babysitter's services to set themsevles up as employers.

I can see it making sense as a full-time babysitter for a single family. But when doing part time work for various families and often changing who those families are, it makes more sense to be self-employed.

Can someone help with the designation here?

"GST withheld due to martial status change, not sure how to send CRA the required documents",1,"Hello,

Recently I noticed the following in my CRA account after I did not receive my recent GST payment:  


>""We cannot calculate the amount you may be entitled to receive for all periods because we do not have all the necessary information. If you provide the information we ask for in the Explanation section, we will process it and let you know if you are entitled.""  
>  
>You have an amount due. It is payable upon receipt of this notice. If you have already paid, please ignore this request.  
>  
>**Amount due:** $564.00   
>  
>Our records show that your current marital status is not the same as the one we used to calculate your 2021 GST/HSTC. As a result, we cannot determine if you are still entitled without the following information: confirmation from you or your spouse of your martial status and the date of the change, your spouse's name and SIN. If this individual immigrated during or after 2021, we need the date of entry and how much world income they made before coming to Canada.

How can I send the required documents and confirmation to the CRA as they are requested? I have already clicked 'Submit Documents' through My CRA account and gave an explanation and letter of explanation file, along with all of the requested documents including all of our tax information for the past two years. I have not received any kind of response or confirmation in weeks.

Me and my wife were married in May 2022 and she has lived here for less than one year. We are still waiting on the spousal sponsorship process to finalize so she can get COPR. My income in 2022 was low, as was hers. 20k combined or just around that, as we spent part of the year in the US. She has never worked since being in Canada as she is legally not able to.

It states online that a married person will receive a larger GST than a single person so I was expecting my GST to be larger, not withheld + having to owe almost $600. It just seems really off.

If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be very much appreciated. Thank you.",2023-04-27 17:38:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/130z4fl/gst_withheld_due_to_martial_status_change_not/
Emigrant vs Non-Resident status,2,"There's not much concrete distinction written about the difference between the two after you get confirmed for it.. but my understanding so far is:

Emigrant: doesn't need to file taxes ever again as long as you paid all the departure tax due. So technically you don't have any obligation at all. No need to elect for 216 or 217. Even if you receive an RSU payout it doesn't matter because you already paid taxes on it as part of your disposition during departure tax

Non-Resident: filing is optional, only if your calculation results to an owing OR you have a clear refund (e.g. you received an RSU payout lets say 7k, you got a T4 issued and a tax withheld of 2k -> in this case the withheld tax is refundable because 7k income has 0 tax). Whenever 1 of these 2 happens and you end up filing a return you will need to include your world income in that return

Is my understanding correct?


While having any of the two statuses, IF you physically receive a rental income (physical in the sense that the rental money gets deposited to your individual account only) then you will need to file a return for that.  
However, if you dont receive the rental income physically (e.g. the property title is under you and a spouse, but the rental income gets deposited only to the spouse's individual account - which you can prove with your spouse's bank statement vs yours) then you don't need to file a return",2023-04-27 16:29:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/130ugty/emigrant_vs_nonresident_status/

"VDP - Redo whole returns vs T1-ADJ forms, plus payment?",1,"Hi everyone. I have two quite specific questions about the Voluntary Disclosure Program and would appreciate any input from people who have been through the process or know about it. I want to ask the CRA but it’s obviously hard to get through to them right now.

To give a little context, I am about to submit an application to the VDP because of failure to report foreign assets and income in previous years. The confusion came from thinking I was tax resident in my home country, whereas I was actually tax resident in Canada from late 2018. I also made some capital gains in 2021 which I did not report in Canada for the same reason. I have put together the T1135s for 2019, 2020 and 2021, plus the Schedule 3 for 2021.

My two questions are:

1) I am a bit confused whether I should fill in a whole new tax return for each year (I did submit tax returns in all years, just without the foreign stuff) or whether I should use the T1-ADJ form to make adjustments for each year? Or a third option? 

2) The CRA says I need to include payment in the application. How do I calculate how much I owe? Is it by filling in a new tax return using tax software (without submitting it) and subtracting the difference from my original return?

I’ll try to update this post on my progress in case it’s helpful for other people in a similar situation. Thank you very much!",2023-04-27 12:57:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/130lchr/vdp_redo_whole_returns_vs_t1adj_forms_plus_payment/

Carrying over Unused Tuition Credits as a returning resident,1,"Hello. I already asked this question to turbotax representative, but she was confused and told me to call CRA tomorrow. Since CRA is on a strike, I would ask here as well:

I was a resident of Canada as an undergraduate till 2014, then switched into factual resident of Canada till June 2019 as a Canadian studying at USA for grad school. I have submitted 2019 tax return, reporting that I became non-resident of Canada at June 2019. I saw that I had a huge amount of unused tuition fees in 2019 tax return.

As I was working in USA from August 2019 to May 2022, I thought I did not need to submit tax return (as I am no longer a resident of Canada), so I did not submit tax return for 2020 and 2021 as I had no incomes to report. However, I returned to Canada for work at June 2022 (now a resident of Canada) and I need to file tax return for tax year 2022.

If I do, then do I get penalty for not submitting tax return (as non-resident) for those years? I thought non-residents don't have to submit tax forms.

Boss telling employees that they're self employed independent contractors when CRA info says they're 'employees'. No taxes have ever been deducted from their pay,13,"&#x200B;

My younger brother has asked me for help with his taxes for this tax year because he's almost positive (as am I) that, when it comes to his taxes, he's been getting taken advantage of by his employer for the last few years since he was hired (and he allowed it to happen by not being more diligent about protecting himself).

My brother's contracted driver boss has for years told his hired household mover labourers (my brother included) that they're ""self employed independent contractors"" even though the CRA website suggests otherwise. What can my brother do about this to make sure that when he files his taxes over the next few days, he's not going to end up screwing himself over with what he will owe, while at the same time doing his best to try not to compromise his boss's job (and consequently his own) if his boss insists on pretending he doesn't know better about the employment status of his hired labour?

My brother wants to avoid asking for a CRA ruling (we're both at least 95% sure they'd just confirm that he's indeed an employee and not self employed, anyway), as that would almost surely lead to his boss getting audited and my brother losing his job (a job which he has no major problems with, aside from these taxation avoidance shenanigans that his boss has been pulling for years).

How to reduce capital gains taxes for secondary residence?,0,"Hi,

I am in Ontario. I am a joint tenant with my primary residence, and I am also the sole owner of a secondary residence cottage. We recently finished the basement in our cottage and we are thinking of selling it in a few years. Is there any way I can reduce the amount of capital gains taxes I would owe upon selling it? 

If I live at the cottage for 75% of the year would that reduce the capital gains taxes I would owe, like a partial percentage primary residence exception or something? Would I need to physically make it my primary residence by updating everything like my drivers license health card and even mailing address with Canada Post to be my cottage address? Or would simply residing at the cottage for like 75% of the year, and all of my GPS data and browser history and internet usage etc be enough to prove to CRA that I did indeed reside at the cottage for like 75% of the year?

Values on my amended T4 paper copy DO NOT match the values on the amended T4 in my CRA account,1,"

CRA guide said to reach out to my employer for guidance. I did. They say to go with the CRA amended version yet, as you can see from the values below, the CRA amended version matches my original T4 (so why the amendment??):


Box 14 & 26= 
$*****.08 (original T4 & amended CRA copy)
$*****.00 (employer-provided amended T4 paper copy)

Box 16= 
$79.81 difference (Higher on amended paper copy; lower on amended CRA and this matches my original T4).

Box 28= 
original nothing checked off; both amended versions have X on PPIP.  (I am employed in Ontario, and this value is getting flagged in Ufile as something that prevents me from using netfile to submit). 

Box 24= 
$*****.66 ( original T4 & amended CRA copy)
$*****.00 (amended paper copy)

 
Both amended versions show a different employer name, so I know an amendment has taken place (original was issued under the business name, and both amended copies issued under the names of the business owners). 

I'm thinking they sent in the amendment but didn't change the values. Can this happen? When is this caught and verified? 

What should I do? Should I use the amended values on the paper copy or the ones the CRA has?

Taxes for 2019 Deceased Uncle - 2022 T4A,1,"Hello,  


My uncle passed away in December of 2018. At the time, he had no assets, he lived in social housing and my grandpa took care of his financials. I have no idea if his 2019 taxes were filed by my grandpa because he doesn't remember anything anymore after a stroke last year. Anyways, my grandparents have had no issues with this.  


In July 2019 by grandparents received mail from CWIPP, a multi-employer pension plan company about money in a pension plan from my uncles previous employer many years before he passed. My grandparents didn't do anything with this at the time. In 2020, they showed me the mail and I told them I will help them get the money for it. My uncle also had no will so I had to apply to become grant of administrator for my uncles estate which took almost 2 years going through the legal process.   


2022 - After obtaining the grant of administrator, I was able to open an estate account at TD and CWIPP sent a cheque with the money for the estate account. Once the money was in the TD estate account, I paid the lawyer fees and then transferred the remaining amount to my grandmas account.   


2023 - I received a T4A with the lump-sum and the income tax deducted amounts. The T4A has the estates of my uncles name on it. My question is how to do I file this tax slip? Do I file the tax slip under the estate? Do I file it under my grandmas personal taxes as she was the once who received the money? I tried to do it through TurboTax under the deceased persons option but it won't allowed a deceased date prior to 2022.   


How do I go about taking care of this?",2023-04-25 01:09:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12y39yg/taxes_for_2019_deceased_uncle_2022_t4a/
Taxes for a deceased person,4,"We (my wife actually) is the executor for an estate and we've just about got all the legal work done for probate.

The deceased has pension and RRSP accounts worth around $80,000 and we'd like to cover these costs from them.  I'd just like to understand that now that its 2023, if we were to withdraw the necessary funds, they'd be taxed in 2023, and thus a new year of personal exemption.  I realize there'd still be a withholding tax, but then we'd do her taxes one more time and those would be refunded.

The remaining amounts in her pension/RRSPs would be distributed in-kind to her beneficiaries, who if they wanted to withdraw them as cash, would then be responsible for the taxes.

Filing taxes from abroad,4,"
Hi everyone! 

I have a few questions about tax filing, 

So basically me and my husband lived in Canada from 2018 to 2022 both international students. We used to file our taxes every year cause we were both working part-time. In 2022 I made around 5,500CAD and his income was 0. 

In July 2022 we moved from Canada to the UK, he is studying here and I am working. I only made 1,300 pounds while living in the UK in 2022. 

We were wondering if we need to file our taxes for 2022 as we’re still considered tax residents as we lived more than 180 days in Canada last year. We don’t have any property etc, the only thing we sold was a car when we were moving out. 

So my questions are: Do we need to file our taxes this year? Do we need to file something called “departure tax”? Should I include my UK income in 2022 in this return? And finally, how to do it if we no longer live in Canada?

My taxes for the previous/current tax cycle are currently being helped with by my parents, but given that I am paying for things and, for most of the year (save a couple weeks) living at this address, would this change for the next (i.e. 2023) year?

I understand that the CRA lists that it's the ""primary place of residence"" and I'm still a resident of BC owing to student residency rules, but my mailing address/etc most relevant markers of residence are in my current address.

Yet another question about food delivery taxes.,2,"This one might be a little odd, so couldn't find too much non-conflicting information on this.

I live at home with my parents, I have a full time job, and I financed a car - the only car in the family. 

Now here's the issue. When I bought the car it wasn't under the intention to do food deliveries. All family names are in the insurance, but the name on the title is mine. 

I transit to work, and rarely drive my car outside of weekends for leisure. My father is retired, and my mother has been doing Uber Eats as a mini-hustle, but otherwise unemployed. We also don't go out much, so about 70-80% of the car's usage is her doing Uber Eats. 

So my question is. Does having the car in my name have any implications of what she can or can't claim as expenses?  


I'm assuming she can still claim expenses on gas and insurance, but I could be wrong?

How about maintenance fees?

Car payment and interests? 

I've always considered my money as my parent's money and vise-versa, that's just the way my culture is even though I know that isn't the case from a government tax standpoint. So this really muddies the distinction between who pays the bills, does the repairs, etc.

T4PS - Unvested Shares,1,"Hi everyone,

My employer matches 3% of my contributions into an RRSP with 1.5% as stock (publicly listed), with a vesting period of 3 years. 

I noted my T4PS had that amount, which reduces my refund amount significantly. Do I have to pay tax on this, even though if I quit today, I won’t get any of this money ? 

Also, in case I do quit this year, do I get this amount paid as tax back next year ?

How to appeal a notice of redetermination for CERB? Still owe total sum after sending in proof of income.,1," 

Hello,

I have a question regarding the notice of redetermination I received for CERB.

In the 12 months before my application for CERB, I earned more than $5000. A few months ago, I received a letter from the CRA requesting proof of income to determine my eligibility for receiving CERB. I sent in 12 monthly invoices for that entire year, demonstrating that I earned more than $5000 in that year.

Despite this, I received a notice of redetermination stating that they redetermined my benefits using the information I provided, but they are still demanding the full sum of money to be repaid. I am currently unable to pay this amount back, and I believe that I was eligible for these benefits.

How can I appeal this notice of redetermination, and is it possible to win this dispute?

RRSP overcontributions,1,"Hi all, so my wife started working last year in Dec 2022 so her 2022 income is $3.6k which means she will have a 2023 deduction limit of about $600. 

Now the problem is, she has contributed about $3900 in 2023 to her RRSP which means she has overcontributed on top of the grace amount of $2000 by $1300. She has also opened an FHSA this year.

I need some guidance on what the best approach to fix her overcontributions is. As I understand, these are her available options,

Option 1 
1. Withdraw $1300 from her RRSP which would create a taxable event.
2. Transfer the $1300 into her FHSA which can then be used as part of the $8000 annual FHSA deduction.


Option 2
1. Direct transfer $1300 from RRSP into FHSA with RC720 form.


Option 1 would incur a taxable event in the form of a RSP withdrawal but it would also enable her to use the amount as a FHSA deduction on her 2023 tax return.

Option 2 would prevent the taxable event since it’s a direct transfer but the transfer would not count towards the FHSA deduction(since it’s a direct transfer)

I’m thinking Option 1 would be better in this case, since it’s an overcontribution and so would not count towards the RRSP deduction anyway? 

Can anyone confirm if I have the right idea here?",2023-04-23 06:03:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12vxvp4/rrsp_overcontributions/
Artist T2125 tax help,3,"Hi! I'm an artist who sells art prints on Etsy. 2022 was my second year in business and I had a local tax prep service help me file last year. Unfortunately, the person who helped me last year no longer works at that business, so I figure I would just save myself the few hundred dollars and do it myself this year (honestly my business is pretty straightforward: I produce art prints, sell it on Etsy, and my expenses are very straightforward as well. It is Etsy fees, material costs of paper/printing, office expenses for things like shipping packaging, delivery expenses, and that's pretty much it. I even walk to the post office or mailbox to deliver my orders, so I don't even have motor expenses). Now I am going through last year's return to see how they did everything last year so that this year's return goes along the lines with what they did. But upon checking again, it looks like they left my COGS closing inventory amount (line 8500) to zero dollars (actually left just blank) which seems like a major mistake to me? We had meetings where I explained to them the nature of my business, and I did tell them a number for my closing inventory last year but they didn't use it?

So I guess my question is, should I leave my opening inventory empty for my 2022 return so that it matches last year's? Or is that ending inventory line being left out from last year's return going to end up being a big deal, and I should I try to contact last year's tax prep service to try to straighten out what happened, and possibly need to adjust last year's tax return as well? The tax filing deadline is really soon, so I realize that I don't have much time left and the service I used last year is of course, going to be super busy this time of year if I were to contact them this late. 

I understand that it is my responsibility to check over my returns even if they are done by someone else, I know I don't have much of an excuse. But the reality is is that I had so much going on this time last year and it was my first time having to report self-employment income that I naively trusted the fact that I was paying someone else to do my taxes for the first time to just get it right for me, and now it's possible that they didn't get it right at all...Any answers or advice about this situation would be much appreciated.",2023-04-23 04:01:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12vuuow/artist_t2125_tax_help/
GST/HST Charging Advice for a Canadian Independent Contractor with International Clients,1,"Hello fellow Redditors,

I'm hoping to get some guidance on charging Canadian GST/HST as a Canadian independent contractor running a corporation.

I do plan on seeking professional advice, but I thought I'd ask here first to see if anyone has similar experiences or insights to share. Please note that I have anonymized the services I provide while maintaining the integrity of the clients' businesses.

Client 1: Based in Canada

* Services provided: Service A (anonymized)
* Client's business: Located in Canada

Client 2: Based in Australia

* Services provided: Service B (anonymized)
* Client's business: Australian company offering B2B SaaS services to Canadian consumers

Client 3: Based in the USA

* Services provided: Service C (anonymized)
* Client's business: US based company offering B2B services mainly to US-based customers (with approximately 1-2 Canadian clients)

All three clients pay my Canadian corporation on a monthly basis. I have the following questions:

1. Should I charge Canadian GST/HST to my Australian client (Client 2), given that they are an international client but their services target Canadian consumers?
2. Which of the clients listed above should I charge the Canadian GST/HST 13% on the invoices I send to them? Should i not charge the USA or Australian based client any GST HST?

RRSP Excess Contribution Questions,1,"I'm kicking myself for not catching this sooner, but when doing my taxes this year I found out that I've overcontributed to my RRSP. I've gone down the rabbit hole of the CRA and other Canadian government websites and I'm still a little confused about the best way to proceed. Here is some context:

My RRSP deduction limit for 2022 is around $10K. I had an automatic payment set up to transfer money into my RRSP and based on my statements, I exceeded my contribution limit sometime in November. Including the contributions made in the first 60 days of 2023, I'm around $6K over the RRSP limit.

I understand that I need to pay some penalties for the over-contributions, but the amounts that show in my tax software (TurboTax) are a little confusing.

**First Q:** It shows that the amount subject to the penalty is only for the excess contributions made in 2022 (i.e. it doesn't count the contributions made in the first 60 days of 2023). Even though I'm $6K over, it shows only $1.5K is subject to the penalty ($6K total excess - $2K buffer - $2.5K contributed in 2023 = $1.5K). Is this correct/make sense? Do I not get penalized for the excess made in the first 60 days of 2023?

**Second Q:** Because my contribution limit will be ""refreshed"" this year (I assume when I complete my tax return...?) and the amount will most likely be more than my excess of the previous tax year, will that ""cover"" the excess? Will the penalties stop accruing?

**Third Q:** Sort of related to the above question, TurboTax states that the $6K will be carried forward to a future year. I assume that the $6K will count towards my 2023 contributions and that I can claim that $6K against my income for 2023. Is this correct?

**Fourth Q:** I assume that for the 2022 taxes, I need to put everything in the form (all contributions including the excess), and deal with the penalties/late penalties, etc.?

My plan at the moment (subject to any recommendations/advice) is to submit my tax return as-is (showing my full/excess RRSP contributions), leave the excess contributions in the RRSP (since the refreshed deduction limit will cover it) and figure out how much to pay as penalties. I think I need to complete a T1-OVP 2022, but that just covers the penalty for the excess and not the late-filing penalty (my fault for dawdling on my taxes!) How do I figure out (and pay) the late filing penalty?

Does this make sense or am I completely out to lunch?",2023-04-22 23:40:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12vnuhd/rrsp_excess_contribution_questions/

Question about small error on T936 form from previous years,1,"I have a small discrepancy on my T936 (calculation of cumulative net investment Loss) form, which appears to be an error on my part, and I am wondering how best to fix it. Specifically, I noticed that line 18 (total investment income reported in previous years) is incorrect. After a bit of looking around, I realized this is because in 2016, I accidentally missed a T5 slip with interest income. That tax return was later reassessed and the correct amount added to my taxable income. However, the amount on line 17 (total investment income reported in that year) of the T936 for 2016 was never adjusted. As a result, line 18 has been incorrect for the five tax years after that (since it is cumulative).

I am wondering what I should do about this. The discrepancy is approximately $200 and I am not claiming a capital gains deduction or anything. Is it fine to simply adjust line 18 for the 2022 tax year and leave the previous tax years with the (relatively small) error?

Am I doing something wrong? Or is it time to change accountant? Need help please!,3,"I am having a bit of a quarrel with my accountant and I need to know who is in the wrong and I have few questions. I know accountants are supposed to be more reliable than reddit, but I already caught few mistakes he made before, so I lost all my trust in his abilities:

Background:

I started my business as a sole-proprietor as of 2022, an IT consultant that is placed by an agency. I bill the agency. I did not register for anything at that point. My HST registration date is Apr-2022 because from Jan 2022 to April 2022 I did not make more than $30,000. For ease of calculations let us assume I made 30k from Jan to Apr and 100k from Apr to Dec, for which I collected 13k HST (Ontario)

1- First of all he said Income tax CAN be calculated using cash basis, and HST HAS to be cash basis. I do not understand why. Shouldn't be accrual basis for both?

2-  When I setup My Business Account I elected to use quick method, my registration date is as per before 1-Apr-2022. My understanding is that I will remit 8.8% of Gross sales including tax meaning 8.8% of 100k+13k --> $9,944 remittance. Accountant is claiming I should do the 8.8% of 100k+30k (the period from jan to apr)+13k ---> $12,584 remittance. Isn't he wrong? shouldn't the 8.8% be on the gross from the date I registered for HST since I am a new registrant not of the whole year? I wasn't collecting HST from jan to apr.

3- Can I still claim 1% on first 30k of the 100k if above is correct?

4- When filling T2125, he doesn't want to input any HST collected. He is putting just the income net of HST meaning the 130k for the whole year. How can he not fill the HST part especially when using quick method?

5- Where does the income from the difference between HST collected and HST remitted appear? is it part of the T2125 calculation? this has to go on my taxable income as I understand.

6- Unfortunately at the end he said I do not qualify for the quick method because I am an HST ""detail filer"" (what?). I feel he did that just out of spite because I kept arguing. Is there a rule that says I cannot use quick method knowing that I am IT consultant and it is my first year and I qualify as a small business? My election for quick method is approved on My Business Account since April 2022.

Also I run a side by side for 100% business use. I am paid a flat rate allowance for that. I have to declare that as income but the CRA won’t allow any deductions for expenses on that. Why would I have to pay income tax on that money without being able to declare the expenses?

RRSP - I may have made a mistake last year. Can you help me clarify?,2,"Hi everyone!

I am a bit confused in regards to RRSP contributions I've made along with my previous employer.

The main question I am trying to answer now is: How much should I declare as ""Unused contributions from your 2021 NOA""

Looking at 2021's NOA, it's says zero, but it seems like there was something to carry on from last year and somehow this wasn't added to Turbotax. Please see my RRSP declaration history below:

2018 NOA: First year filling tax.

2019 NOA:

* Allowable RRSP contributions deducted for 2019: $0
* Unused RRSP contributions previously reported and available to deduct for 2020: $152

2020 NOA:

* Allowable RRSP contributions deducted for 2020: $179
* Unused RRSP contributions previously reported and available to deduct for 2021: $152

2021 NOA:

* Allowable RRSP contributions deducted for 2021: $152
* Unused RRSP contributions previously reported and available to deduct for 2022: $0

This year I am using Wealthsimple, and according to information automatically imported from CRA, the current state as far as CRA goes is:

|Tax Year|Unused contributions|Current year contributions|Total available contributions|HBP or LLP repayment|Contributions deducted|Total unclaimed RRSP contributions|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021|$152.00|$152.00|$152.00||||
|2020|$152.00|$179.00|$331.00|$179.00|$152.00||

&#x200B;

According to CRA, the total of unclaimed RRSP is $0. HOwever, I don't recall ever withdrawing/claiming my RRSP contributions. Also, it was an RRSP started with my previous employer but I left shortly after. I think there was some sort of contribution policy like if I left in less than a year, they would ""take their contribution back?"". Not sure about this, but could this be related to that""HBP or LLP repayment""?

How come 2020 says I deducted $152 but they still show up in 2021 as ""unused""?

If anyone can help me clarify this situation I'd appreciate! As I move away from TurboTax and use Wealthsimple for the first time, I am having a bit of a hard time clarifying some stuff I've done last year.",2023-04-22 15:21:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12v95ch/rrsp_i_may_have_made_a_mistake_last_year_can_you/

Does the CRA ever audit for differences between T slips they recieved and what you submit in taxes? Sometimes the t5 error are quite enormous amounting to several thousand dollars in imaginary gains so don't know if the CRA i doing a blanket scan for these or something.

The agent told me to send them a letter (pen and paper and old-school snail-mail!?!). 

Fast forward another 2 weeks, they are amending my T4 to include those EI remittens. 

I tried to call them today but I think they are on strike.

What seemed to be a simple problem has turned to be an annoying headache...

RRSP employer contributions vs hourly rate,0,"RRSP employer contributions vs hourly rate

If someone is smart enough to figure this out it might be a fun tax thing for you tax enjoyers.

My employer offers rrsp contributions which is 8$/hr into an rrsp. They also allow you to opt out of it and get 8$/hr onto your paycheque. 

Which option is the best to pay the least in taxes and get the most of your money? I would be taking out my rrsp at the end of the year and would receive a 20% tax on the withdrawal. 

Is it worth it to pay the income tax on it initially or the 20% tax at the end of the year?

That is a total of $2250 refundable tax credits that I missed!

From what I understand, this particular amendment is not allowed (according to CRA website) to be done through software refile (via turbotax or other filing software). It's one of those exceptions to refile apparently.  So I tried to use the ""change return"" function in my CRA online account, but can only input an amount ($250) for the Canada job training credit (line 45350).  Line 47900 (the Ontario jobs training tax credit) shows up as a line in the ""change return"" function, but there is no ability to input an amount. However you can delete the line - so helpful.  So now I am wondering if CRA ""change return"" is smart enough to apply the Ontario jobs training tax credit if all I do is change the Canada jobs training credit (line 45350).

Additional interest charges keep increasing even though arrears have been paid in full already before due date,1,"CRA notice of re-assessment stated that to avoid additional interest charges pay xxx before  April 28th.  It was paid off last week in full. Still the interest charges seem to increase every day when I look at My CRA portal.

Is this a usual practice? Do they reverse the charges later on and issue a refund later on or am I not interpreting their statement correctly?

EDIT: I can confirm that the interest rate is rising daily even though the letter of assessment clearly indicated that further interest will not be applicable if full payment is made by April 28th. Clearly CRA does not honour its own commands.

And there is no balance owing, full payment has already been made, but then again who is working at CRA now. Even though I made the payment for the specific category that CRA agent asked me to, it won't be applied till an agent manually verifies it. God know when that will happen. It took them a mere 342 days from the day of assessment to just mail me a letter of assessment. of course they charged me interest for the 342 days

Got a T4A for a commission I accepted for my dad who doesn't live here. Not my income what should I do?,1,"Hi all,

My dad is a student counselor in my home country. I am a Canadian PR. He helps process student applications for certain North American universities and he gets a commission if the students enrol successfully. And he's officiated by these universities. 

This year, because I am now a Canadian PR and moved here, we figured that me retrieving the commission from the universities is easier rather than wire transfer. Then I just transfer the amount in cash to my father. My father is not as young as he used to be and so releasing the wire transfer back at home is taxing (pun intended lol). 

A month ago the university sends me a T4A with my SIN Number. 

I don't know why the university did this when we agreed it's just changing the method of payment. It's not my income. 

Question - do I have to report this in my returns? 

I don't want this to be taxed and the tax seems to be nearly 50% of the small 1K commission fee that my dad gets. Which is ridiculous. If it was 100ish dollars I wouldn't mind and I'd just pay for it.

Can anyone give us a straight answer? We've filed jointly customarily, but could this be a case where  our statuses are different and require separate claims? Any answers (or other subreddits that can help) are massively appreciated! I'm more than happy to provide any further details required.

First time filing tax return in Canada - can I do it myself?,1,"Hi everyone,

I moved to Canada last year with PR. This year would be the first time I'd file a tax return here in Canada. 

I have only one T4 form from my employer. 

I work remotely and live in Ontario. My employer is from NS. So I pay higher taxes than I should. 

I filled out everything on turbotax and downloaded the form since I was ineligible to e-file as it is my first time. 

Advice needed:

Should I just mail the turbotax filled T1 generalized condensed form? 
- I'm not sure how cra is supposed to pay me - didn't seem to take any direct deposit details. 

Or 

Would you all recommend me going to a tax service and not risking making mistakes? I'm kind of worried about the residence vs employer province calculation. 


Thanks in advance.",2023-04-18 19:14:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12r0sf4/first_time_filing_tax_return_in_canada_can_i_do/
Kids sports,1,"I've read the circular from the CRA and my understanding is that sports is only eligible as a childcare deduction if the primary purpose is childcare, not sports training. So my kid's soccer summer camp should be eligible, but the regular soccer registration for the year should not be. However, the invoices from our soccer club have the whole amount as deductible. (See image - by my understanding, only the $175 should be eligible.)

I asked the club about this - if they have some special designation that allows the regular soccer program to be deductible for childcare - and no one can really give me an answer. If the receipt says it's eligible, can I assume they are right and claim it? (If it makes a difference, I actually do use the regular year training as childcare - i.e. I schedule meetings and work during most of that time.)

Beneficiary of a foreign (U.S.) based permanent life insurance policy,6,"I've recently been given some bad news about my (U.S. citizen & resident, with no ties to Canada) father, whom it looks like may only have a few short years before being able to manage his own affairs and, possibly death.

A few years ago I was told that my sibling and I were named 50/50 beneficiaries of a substantial life insurance policy.

Since I suspect this detail might matter: the way the plan was explained to me was that the benefit was ""defined"" i.e. it cost my father a single flat fee on day 0 and the payout would be the same regardless of he died on day 1 or if he died 30 years later and it would be tax free. Needless to say, when my father set up the insurance -- which is irrevocable and unchangeable -- he did not anticipate I would immigrate to Canada.

Is this kind of life insurance benefit taxable here in Canada? I've tried googling but most of the information I'm able to find only seems to speak to Americans receiving a death benefit from a Canadian plan rather than the other way around.",2023-04-18 17:51:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12qy3ms/beneficiary_of_a_foreign_us_based_permanent_life/
Missed T3's on 2021 Return,10,"I missed a couple of T3's on my 2021 return, due to life circumstances it simply slipped my mind to file them. I guess CRA caught it because I recieved a friendly request to 'provide documentation showing where these were filed / my worksheet' etc.

Broker won't report non-cash distributions on T3,1,"I received a T3 slip for one of my ETFs (ZCN) and Box 21 (Capital Gains) was empty. I found this curious, since a number of my other ETFs had capital gains this year, so I cross-checked this against my ETF issuer's website.

The website DOES show that $0.510419 per share of capital gains was taxable in 2022; however it seems like this was part of a non-cash (i.e. reinvested) distribution. When I pointed this out to my broker, they responded by saying that they ""do not support reporting of non-cash distributions"".

This seems wrong, no? Shouldn't the onus be on the broker to report all capital gains on the T-slip, whether or not is is paid out in cash?

What next steps should I take? I am holding off on filing my taxes until this issue is resolved.

Confusing tax advice from consultants,3,"I wanted to get some thoughts on an interesting tax situation. The company my wife works for had a private sale where an investment company bought a portion of the company. The company she works for is private and this company had previously issues stocks to all employees. A portion of these shares got bought out by the investment company. When her company issued the T4, the taxable income was disclosed. However, there is a capital gains portion which the company did not issue a t5008 for. 

To clarify the above consider the following scenario. 

\- Company granted 10k stocks worth $50 each. 

\- The 10k stocks were sold to an investment company for $150 a piece. 

\- Taxes for the grand were deferred due to the company being CCPA.

&#x200B;

The company issued a T4 outlining the income of 500k. However her company did not issue a tax slip for capital gains ($150x10000-$50x10000). 

&#x200B;

Normally we do our own taxes, but this time due to the above complication we talked with few tax consultants. In speaking with these consultants, they indicated to not disclose the capital gains since there is no t5008. This seems shady to me. However, the odd thing is that all 4 companies I spoke with said the same thing. Another thing is that these aren't small neighbourhood tax consultants. These are fairly known companies with excellent ratings. 

&#x200B;

So my main question is if someone has been in similar situation. Also, the other thing I wanted to verify is that if they say this is not necessary and we don't disclose it but CRA comes back later and says it's not correct then would there be penalty? The tax consultants above are okay with indicating this wiritten communication that the capital gains doesn't need to be disclosed.",2023-04-17 22:04:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12pyrgo/confusing_tax_advice_from_consultants/

RRSP overcontribution,3,"In August 2022, I mistakenly sent a lump sum to my RRSP account which put me in excess of 2867$ based on the deduction limit appearing in my CRA account. When I realized my mistake in December 2022, I immediately withdrew 2867$ from my RRSP account in order to stop any potential penalties.

As a result of this, I received a T4RSP indicating that I received an income of 2867$ from RRSP withdrawals. Simultaneously, my 2022 RRSP receipt still includes the excess amount in my total contributions. 

1) I am confused as to which forms I need to fill out. I've looked into the T746 and the T1-OVP, but they seem to apply only for 2021 and before, not for 2022 filings. Since I withdrew the excess in the same year and before filing that year's tax return, am I exempt from filling out these forms? 

2) If I do need to fill out a form, can you help me figuring out which, and how to send them? When I look at T746 and T1-OVP, I don't see any instructions as to where to send them. TurboTax doesn't include these forms anywhere either. I am quite confused as to what to do with them if I do need to fill them out.

HST/GST Rebate for Sole Proprietorship who is HST/GST Exempt,2,"I've been operating as I.T. consultant / contractor for an overseas company for the past 5 years. I do not charge HST/GST on the services I provide, therefore my HST/GST bill that I owe is always zero.

I have been doing this for the past 5 years uisng the Employee and Partner GST/HST Rebate Application (GST370). The amount that I have claimed has never been more than $150 (which is probably why it was never questioned).

For 2022, I moved into a co-working office that charges HST/GST on the office rent. Therefore the amount that I have claimed for 2022 is approx. $1500. I just received a review letter from the CRA after submitting my return requesting a full breakdown of the expenses (I used Wealthsimple Tax to submit my return and their categories for this are not that descriptive, I used 'Other Expense' for most of them).

\- I don't actually owe any HST/GST

\- Self-employed persons who are not members of a registered partnership cannot claim the rebate on their income tax return

EI and WSIB payments question,1,"I was in receipt of EI benefits for several months of 2022 while I appealed a WSIB decision which denied me loss of earnings payments for that time period in which I could not work due to injury.

My WSIB appeal has since been partially succesful, and I should be receiving WSIB loss of earnings this year for some of the time in which I received EI in 2022. 

Of course I am aware I will have to return the EI payments I received for this period of time, but I have a few questions about this process:

1) If the WSIB wage calculation results in a lower loss of earnings wage entitlement than what EI had given me, will I still be obligated to return the entire EI benefits for that period or would I be able to keep the difference (I'm guessing not)?  

2) Reading [this guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4115/guide-t5007-return-benefits.html) by the CRA on T5007, I found this example which is similar to my situation:

>**When reimbursements of wage-loss replacement plan benefits are deductible** – An employee received $5,000 as wage-loss replacement plan benefits in year A. This amount is included in income in year A. In year B,  the employee receives another $5,000 in wage-loss replacement plan  benefits and workers' compensation benefits of $15,000. It is later  determined that he is required to reimburse $8,000 of the wage-loss  replacement plan benefits. For year B, he would include both the $5,000 wage-loss replacement  and the $15,000 workers' compensation benefits in his income. Assuming  these are his only sources of income, his total income would be $20,000.  He is entitled to an $8,000 deduction representing the reimbursement of  the wage-loss replacement plan benefits as other employment expenses  (repayment of salary or wages). He can also deduct the $15,000 of  workers' compensation benefits which he added to his income. After  deducting these amounts from net income, he has a non-capital loss of  $3,000. This can be carried back 3 years and forward 20 years and deducted from income from all sources. If it is carried back to the previous tax years, the employee should send to his [tax centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4115/guide-t5007-return-benefits.html#P364_34463) a completed [Form T1A, Request for Loss Carryback](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1a.html), or a signed letter providing the details of the request.

What i dont understand is this:

>He can also deduct the $15,000 of  workers' compensation benefits which he added to his income.

Why would the person be eligible to deduct worker's compensation benefits from his total income?  Is it not taxable?  Does this mean that I can deduct what I end up returning to EI, and my payment from WSIB will also not be taxable this year?

3) I may be receiving my WSIB payment in the next week or two.  Should I be waiting to file my 2022 return until I know how much I will be returning to EI, or will that all be sorted out on my 2023 return?

Found error in my 2013 Tax Return - What can I do?,2,"In my notice of assessment from 2013 I realized that my pension adjustment line was $51,850 instead of $5,850

I do recall I had a a re-assessment done this year, i don't recall exactly why, but i believe my employer had to re-issue my T4 due to an error on their end and i had to file again.

I looked into 2014 NOA, and confirmed that the carry forward contribution room had the error (so the re-assessment didn't fix the error)

Can I get this fixed to get the additional contribution room, or is 10 years too late?

If so how?

Bonus question: in 2020 i overcontributed to my RRSP (but by less then $2000, so there was no penalty) Is there a way for me to also increase my RRSP overcontribution forgiveness limit back up to $2000 (I believe it is at around $700 now)

Should I file T4PS form?,1,"Hi - I have a question about whether or not I should file the T4PS form on my tax return. 

- I recieved a T4PS from my employer in the mail, for a bonus that I opted to take in cash

- I noticed that the my CRA login does not have any record of a T4PS form under the 2022 tax documents. I only see my T4 forms

- In addition, when I use the 'Auto Fill My Return' feature to fill in my tax forms on Wealth Simple Tax, the T4PS is not imported. Only my T4 forms are imported

Do I need to report the T4PS individually on Wealth Simple Tax? Or has it already been included in my T4 within my employment income and box 40?

Question on Transferred amout between spouses,0,"Hello,

First of all, this is my first post on Reddit, so I am open to suggestions if I do not ask my question correctly.

My spouse have to pay 4000$ to the federal, I have to pay 350$ to the federal. (Note that we each pay from our own and personal check account - not from a joint account). With the possibility to do a transferred amount between spouses, he now owes 3000$ to the federal, and I will also receive a 665$ payment from the federal, that I will wire back to him. I no more have to pay the 350$ to the federal. However, spouse says that I still should pay those 350$ back to him. 
I am confused and I need advice, please. Could accountants, fiscalists and/or community redditers who have experience on this transferred amount explain to me if this is how it should be done?

NR4 and ROC - Return of Capital for non-resident,0,"Hello,  
As a non-resident holding investments in Canada with Questrade, I understand that ROC are not subject to withholding tax.

I received NR4 forms from Questrade, but the summary and form is quite confusing to me. 

Is the NR4 supposed to show how much total tax was withheld from all my investments with Questrade? Because the tax withheld in the NR4 is not reflecting how much tax I actually paid. Is there another form that would show this?

It appears that Questrade applied the 15% tax on everything. 

How would I claim back the withheld tax on the ROC?

"Own 2 units - moved from one to the other, do I need to tell the CRA",0,"My understanding is that when I make the move from one unit to the other I am supposed to get both of them assessed at the current market price by an assessor or realtor so that I can correctly claim the difference in capital gains when I sell vs when I moved out of the first unit. Meaning say I bought unit 1 at 500,000, that unit appreciates to 600,000 by the time I decided to move out. Then when I sell unit 1 for say 675,000 later on, my capital gain should only be on the 75,000 it appreciated from 600k to 675k, because the first 100k from 500 to 600k doesn't count because of the principal residence capital gain exemption. 

Now since I made that move already, do I have to tell the CRA somehow with some form that I made the move from 1 unit to another or is just having the assessment done and keeping the records for future taxes when I actually dispose of unit 1?

Tax return - foreign income including rental income,1,"Hello, I'm aware that I should probably speak to an accountant but hopefuly that the bright minds here can help clarify things a little for me first.

I'm completing my 2022 Canadian return (resident of BC as of December 31st) and have recently completed my home country (NZ) return. All of my income is being declared as foreign income on my Canadian return and I have already paid tax in NZ on it.

The part that's confusing me is I also received rental income in NZ in 2022 for about five months of the year while I was in Canada. This home is my primary home in NZ.

I'm using CouldTax and the simplest way seems to be to declare it all as T2209 foreign income (employement income + my rental income) and the tax paid on it. I'm having trouble completing the T776 rental income form on CloudTax as it's a foreign property address. Would this create issues filing the return if I grouped it all on the T2209 form?

I use UFile and CRA auto fill my return.

Can someone explain what this means ""Total unclaimed RRSP contributions"", which is different from the NOA where it states ""Unused RRSP contributions previously reported and available to deduct for 2022"", is it currently equal to zero?

Further info on my questions:

""If you have an unused contribution to your RRSP from the first 60 days of 2021, the reporting method will depend on the actual situation.""

\-I do not have unused contributions as NOA shows zero as stated in my question.

""If the amount was reported in 2021 and not used in 2021, therefore carried over to 2022, then it is an unused contribution and the UFile program would have carried it over to 2021.""

\-I do not have unused contributions as NOA shows zero as stated in my question.

""If you have a RRSP from the first 60 days of 2021, and it was never reported before, then you have to make an adjustment to your 2021 tax return or if you successfully NetFiled your 2021 tax return you can ReFILE your 2021 return after you have made the entry into your 2021 return.""

\-there were no contributions made in the first days of 2021, hence, nothing to report.

Ufile is showing ""Total unclaimed RRSP contributions"" for previous years (going back to a few years for my tax returns) after downloading the data from CRA in the section CRA-Autofill-my-return.  It is possible but not certain that these amounts were not ""claimed"" or used for gross income deduction.  That is, RRSP contributions were reported but the full amount were not entirely claimed for those years.  Hence, a balance remained.

**First**, what does  ""Total unclaimed RRSP contributions"" mean?

**Second**, how would I claim the amounts Total unclaimed RRSP contributions for those previous years?

I can't submit the NR304 form ""Direct Deposit for Non-Resident Tax Refunds"" yet as I do not have a ""non-resident account number."" Does this non-resident account number get assigned to previous Canadian residents and does it show up on the notice of assessment?

Background: I (a tax non-professional) recently completed a ""Income Tax and Benefit Return for Non-Residents"" on behalf of a non-resident who was previously a Canadian permanent resident who filed for all previous years he received Canadian-sourced income.

From what I've read on the [CRA website](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/netfile-overview/eligibility.html), NETFILE isn't available for non-residents, nor is [T1 EFILE](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/efile-electronic-filers/file-returns.html), so I prepared a T1 return using tax software and mailed the required printouts to the CRA.

Charging HST as a freelancer,2,"Hi everyone,

Im not sure this is the right sub but looking for some advice on my tax situation as a freelancer.

I live in Ontario and very recently have begun working full time as an actor. Primarily a voice actor, with clients primarily in the United States.

I have recently gotten a Canadian voice over agent, and have started doing on-camera acting work. 

I haven't applied for a business number up until now, as I've never been close to the 30K income limit that requires it, and as most of my business is out of the states, my understanding is that I don't need to charge HST for those clients, right?

But now that I'm starting to work with more Canadian clients (and hopefully making more money) should I be setting up that business number? Once I pass 30K, do I owe that 13% on everything I made up until that point? If so, I should probably just start charging that now, correct?

The other question I have is, I've been doing voice over work under an alias up until this point. I prefer to continue to use that alias online, but I don't want to have to register a business under that name. If I register as a sole proprietor using my legal name, can I continue to use my alias online? Can I use it as my email? Do I have to include my legal name on my invoices?

I'm very confused about this whole situation. Any advice (or pointing me to a better sub of I'm in the wrong place!) would be very appreciated. Thanks!",2023-04-14 19:57:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12mb957/charging_hst_as_a_freelancer/

I owe taxes but need someone to ELI5 the reason I was given as to why I owe.,1,"So, I submitted my tax documents last week and got them back from my advisor today.  I don’t make a lot of money but do have quite a bit of investments.

I have a balance owing (which I am not surprised about) and the amount owing is quite a bit of money.

I was told that the main reasons were because of my capital gains and dividends from my investments that had no tax withheld.

This might be silly but can someone explain to me in layman’s terms what this means exactly?  I am slightly confused.  Is this something that can ever be changed in the future to avoid this happening again?

This is my first time doing the tax for my parent and my mom has invest in GIC in 2021. She invests around 100K with an interest of around 2%. Her gic earning interest is $ 1,980.00. But there is no T5 given by the bank when I checked. As my research says, the bank will give you a T5 if the interest is more than $50, which is weird. Now I'm trying to declare her GIC using Wealthsimple tax. Which they told me to declare under other investment.

Workspace in the home - multiple people in designated spaces.,2,"I'm confused. We're using the detailed method to claim workspace in the home expenses and have signed t2200s. 

The CRA example for multiple people in designated workspaces is to use the % of the home that they calculate for their space. (In this case, two separate offices at 6% and 4% respectively. )

If the two people (spouses) paid 20k in rent, do they get to claim 6% and 4% respectively? Or do they need to divide the rent in half first, before taking the %? 

Screen shots from Canada.ca. I was told that dividng the rent in half was only required if you didn't have designated workspaces. Eg: common space or a shared office. And that if you had designated spaces than you didn't have to divide it.

Need help. Forgot to add T5008 information to tax return.,1,"Hello,

I just filed my taxes electronically.  I failed to enter several transactions on one of my T5008 forms (I have multiple accounts from three banks).

I understand that you need to wait until the NOA is issued to make any amendments.  However, I wanted to see if I could add the T5008 information, using a prior tax return as a dummy test.

However, the CRA only allows T3 and T5 information to be added, not T5008.

The only thing I can come close to is to modify the line 13200, which is the total capital gains or losses.

This means that I would have to manually calculate the new capital gain/loss and enter it in the box.  However, it does not even allow me to modify any other box to show how I arrived at that figure (proceeds of disposition and book cost).  Does the CRA even care how I arrived at the figure, or do they just look at the total in 13200?  I would imagine that the information in the T5008 is important to them, so why do they have no way to supply it?

What should I do?  Thanks in advance.",2023-04-12 20:32:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12jy3yi/need_help_forgot_to_add_t5008_information_to_tax/

US Remote job and living in Canada,7,"\- I was on H1B visa in US and moved to Canada sometime last year. I am remote employee who is supposed to remotely work within 50 miles of the office location. I am actually working in Canada without employers' knowledge. My payroll is in US for last 6 months or so.

\- I plan to submit Departing tax return for 2022. I plan to claim my US salary in 2022 Q4 as Canadian source and ask for foreign tax credit from IRS.

\- For 2023, I will get transferred sometime in the next 2-3 months. I plan to claim all 2023 income as Canadian source and claim for foreign tax from IRS. I went to US for some days but keeping it less than 31 days to claim as non-resident. I have passive income in US (rental, stocks, and bank interests).

This is what my CPA has suggested. They have also said that worst case, I may get double taxed if IRS considers my 2023 income as US sources while CRA thinks it to be Canadian sourced. I was also told my Canadian CPA that if I claim for foreign credit in Canada, they will ask for letter from employer to tell that I was physically present in US. This is not possible because I am remote and I was not in US anyways. The reason of not getting transferred with the same company is that I get paid 30-40% less on Canadian side. I will get transferred anyways within next few months (before end of 2023).

Vague uncertainties regarding a company vehicle and taxable benefits.,1,"So I don't know what I'm saying but I'll try to be concise and break this down into 3 fact only sections.

The question is... at what point will I need to declare benefit and/or is there any risk of audits going back at this point.

1. I have a company vehicle. Zero of the annual 17500 km I drive are for business use. I drive to and from work. The vehicle is supplied to move my tools from site to site (although I never change jobs midday, so it's technically all personal). This amounts to 17,500km a year give or take.

2. My company recently informed me that basically if they ever get audited they will need to declare this which they have been avoiding.
They are currently not filing or sending the (T40/2200?). This is all not happening.

3. My accountant (good and qualified) has informed me that should my employer ever get audited, they can't further come after the employees for not claiming as income since there is nothing declared to claim from the employers level.

So the question is as such. I have been filing my taxes accurately with the forms provided by my employer for the past 3 years.

A: Is there any risk that if the CRA catches on, I'll need to back date my last 3 years and include this? Basically is it on ME to state the taxable benefit, or am I clear because they aren't claiming it so I'm technically filing correctly with the paperwork provided? Is the onus on me to decide I need additional forms to file correctly, or is it on them for not claiming it therefore I CAN'T claim it?

Also what a joke. I can buy my own vehicle and run it for a year for so much cheaper than the $0.29/km benefit portion I would claim as additional income, so either way once I get some answers it'll be time to ditch this van at the office and start heaping my car full of tools whenever required. If this becomes a concern I'm gunna daily a motorbike and use the van once every few months to move jobsites as needed. I can't afford .29/km, I mean I can but if the van tax costs me ~$15x/100km, my car costs me half that with wear and tear and has AC and isn't a 20 year old ****box hahaha.",2023-04-11 14:32:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12ilois/vague_uncertainties_regarding_a_company_vehicle/

Understanding CRA election and taxation concerning Roth 401(k) employer plans,3,"The CRA has published [*Income Tax Folio S5-F3-C1, Taxation of a Roth IRA*](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-5-international-residency/folio-3-cross-border-issues/income-tax-folio-s5-f3-c1-taxation-roth-ira.html), which lays out Canadian income tax treatment of **Roth IRAs**. The key points are:

* Roth IRAs are pensions under Article XVIII of the Treaty (1.8)
* An election can be made under paragraph 7 of Article XVIII of the Treaty to defer taxation of Roth IRAs in Canada (1.9)
* Distributions from Roth IRAs are not taxable in Canada (1.11)
* Canadian Contributions result in the loss of Treaty benefits (1.12 - 1.13)
* Conversions from Traditional IRAs or qualified retirement plans (such as Traditional 401(k) plans) count as Canadian Contributions (1.14)

However, nothing in sections 1.1 - 1.23 of Income Tax Folio S5-F3-C1 specify income tax treatment of **Roth 401(k) plans** (the document only references rollovers and conversions from *Traditional 401(k) plans* to *Roth IRAs*). Rather, under *The Election and other US retirement arrangements*, the Folio states:

* Roth 401(k) plans qualify as a pension under the Treaty but are not foreign retirement arrangements (1.26)
* The CRA understands that employers make contributions to Roth 401(k) plans and therefore they are characterized as either employee benefit plans (EBP) or retirement compensation arrangements (RCA) (1.26)
* Interests in EBPs and RCAs are not subject to current taxation on income accrued in these arrangements, meaning an election under the Treaty is *not* required (1.26)
* Where no employer contributions are made, Roth 401(k) plans are not considered EBPs or RCAs, meaning an election under the Treaty *is* required (1.27)
* Elective salary deferrals do *not* count as employer contributions, so an election under the Treaty *is* required (1.28)
* Employer contributions to *any* participant in a Roth 401(k) plan is sufficient to count as an EBP or RCA, so an election under the Treaty is *not* required (1.28)

Furthermore, CRA tax letter [*9 November 2020 External T.I. 2020-0846401E5 - Tax Treatment of Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA*](https://taxinterpretations.com/cra/severed-letters/2020-0846401e5) answers the following about **Roth 401(k) plans** specifically:

>What is the Canadian tax treatment of a Roth 401(k)  
>  
>It is our understanding that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) allows for the creation of a separate Roth 401(k) account within a 401(k) plan where some or all of the elective contributions of an employee-participant of the 401(k) plan can be designated as Roth contributions, which are generally included in that individual’s gross income for U.S. tax purposes in the year in which the contributions were made. Accordingly, a 401(k) plan could contain both pre-tax contributions and post-tax Roth contributions. **Since a Roth 401(k) is simply a feature of a 401(k) plan, it is our view that the Canadian tax treatment of a Roth 401(k) follows the Canadian tax treatment of the underlying 401(k) plan of which it is a feature**. See paragraphs 1.26 and 1.27 of the Folio for information on the characterization of a 401(k) plan under the Act.

Note the emphasized sentence and the references back to Income Tax Folio S5-F3-C1 sections 1.26 and 1.27.

Therefore, as far as I understand:

1. Canadian residents do **not** need to file an election under the Treaty **nor** report on form T-1135 any Roth 401(k) plans that had an employer contribution component, such as salary deferral matches or profit sharing contributions, even if they did not receive such employer contributions themselves.
2. Employer contributions to a Roth 401(k) plan do **not** count as Canadian Contributions.
3. Employee contributions to a Roth 401(k) plan *with* an employer contribution component do **not** count as Canadian Contributions.
4. Employee contributions to a Roth 401(k) plan *without* an employer contribution component **do** count as Canadian Contributions.

Questions: Deemed non-resident,3,"Hi all, I have a moderately complicated (though I imagine fairly common) situation that I'm working on getting professional advice on but I would love to hear your opinions too. I left Canada in August 2022 (over 183 days in Canada) to live and work in Germany for a couple years. I have rental property in Canada, bank accounts, etc. I'm fairly confident that I'm a deemed non-resident but what I'm confused about it whether that's beneficial to me, should I instead aim to set things up to be able to be considered a factual resident going forward?

As a factual resident I would file taxes in Canada with my worldwide income, file in Germany, show the foreign tax paid, and presumably pay a small difference. As a deemed non-resident I would also file a tax return due to the rental property but I don't believe I would need to report my employment income and thus would deal solely with the Germans. Is this generally correct?

Edit: I do not meet the requirements to be a deemed non-resident in 2022 but I most likely will in 2023 so the question remains for future years. ",2023-04-10 06:01:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12h90xc/questions_deemed_nonresident/
"Owing $23k, and additional $30k in quarterly instalments",1,"So I owe the CRA about $23k in taxes this 2022 tax year, thanks to having multiple employees and not realizing the individual tax deductions were not enough from each one to offset my total income.

Claiming different classes of CCA against a rental property.,2,"I’m putting the focus on getting my taxes done by the end of the month but am still unclear about claiming some non-building related CCA for our rental property. 
We bought a house in 2022 which came with an unfurnished rental unit in the basement. The previous tenants left and we decided to fit the place up and offer it as a finished apartment. We incurred several thousands of dollars buying furniture and pots and pans and bedding etc. 
I think I understand the drawbacks to claiming CCA (Class 1) on the building itself (having to reclaim the CCA as income if we sold and the property didn’t depreciate, and possibly losing the PRE (although it’s not clear to me that PRE would even ever be available if it’s a completely separate apartment albeit within the same structure as the whole house)). But what about claiming claiming Class 8 for the furniture, or Class 12 for the linens and kitchen utensils?  All the guidance I can find on the CRA website references the PRE drawbacks of claiming *any* CCA on the unit, without specifying Class 1.  What about depreciating the costs of the furniture and other fittings which are different classes than the building - which was more than all rental income we took in for the year. Even my tax software (HR Block) asks me if I want to claim any CCA on the rental, but then gives the option to select any class of CCA. Does CRA distinguish between which classes of CCA were claimed against a rental other than Class 1, or will any depreciation cause us to lose the PRE?",2023-04-09 15:46:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12gmyh1/claiming_different_classes_of_cca_against_a/

Archived tax filing,2,"(Have used seached bar) 

&#x200B;

Just a quick background story. I left Canada in 2015 to live abroad and 2015 was the last year I worked in Canada. I had been in contact with the CRA (2018) for another issue which i resolved  - and at that time there was no mention of the 2015 tax year. I asked them if I was all clear and they said that you did not file 2015 but the cra did it on your bhelaf. This is where I got confused and brushed it off. 

They sent me a collection notice in the mail  (February 2023)  First one ever. That I have not filed my taxes from 2015 and saying I owed a massive sum of money. The bigger issue is there is a large amount they are saying I made overseas which is impossible as I was  in Canada. 

The lady I have been speaking to on the phone (CRA Agent) Told me that it may be due to the fact that that is what I made in previous years aborad and due to not filling they just assumed that I had made that amount and inwhich case my friend had the same issue before and was resolved.  The bigger issue for me  now is that when I went to file my taxes for 2015 (Its very late I know  - there was a huge miscommunocation on my part I so I am dealing with it.)  all tax filing websites are saying that this year has be archived and cant not be filed. 

So the amount owing to the cra is based on that income (abroad)- They are saying I owe t alot of money. But becuase I did not work aborad the amount owning would be about 15% of what they are saying as I did work in Canada for 5 months only. 

Does anyone know what I can do in this situation? I have been googling around - hours onhold with CRA and I just want some insight.

How to report vested RSUs on tax return?,0,"Hi, 

I always used to do my taxes because of their simplicity, but last year I got some RSUs and things got a bit more complicated. Before looking for an accountant I just wanted to check first If I could do it all by myself.

My case: 

Last year some of my RSUs vested and I was also part of some ESPP rounds in the US company where I was working. I ""sell to cover"" both RSUs and ESPP when they vested, so some stocks were sold to pay the taxes. Other than that, I didn't sell or buy anything.

This year I got a document (from the company handling the stocks) that states the last year transactions and, for each transaction, it shows **""total proceeds""**, **""cost basis""**, **""realized gain or loss""**, etc.

In the platform I use for filling my taxes, I can add capital gain (or losses) transactions and for each transaction I can add: **""proceeds""**, **""adjusted cost base(ACB)""**, **""gain (loss)""**. 

So I'm wondering If It's just a matter of doing the matching between **""total proceeds"" -> ""proceeds""**, **""cost basis"" -> ""ACB""** and **""realized gain or loss"" -> ""gain (loss)""**.  Using the USD-> CAD conversion rate of that transaction day.

Is that it? Am I missing something?

Tax Return Departure Date,2,"Hello, I moved to the U.S. last August. I have filed my US federal tax return as a non-resident alien for 2022 as I have not passed the SPT, and didn’t want to bother with electing first year choice. 

As such, I’m a tax resident for Canada for all of 2022. In 2023, I will become a resident alien in the US. Based on the tax treaty that I can only be a tax resident of one of Canada or the US, I will be a non resident of Canada for 2023. Also because I have no strong ties - no property or anything.  

Do I put Dec 31 as my date of departure when filing my 2022 T1, or Jan 1 when I file for 2023? Just a bit confused on this since it still asks for my province or territory of residence on Dec 31, which I’d probably put Ontario since that’s where my tax residency would still be? Jan 1st would be the day I become a U.S. resident alien. 

In addition, how do I enter a foreign mailing address into the T1 - the PDF seems to only accept entering a Canadian address (province, postal code, no country) -since this is just a mailing address, can I just enter a Canadian address I can receive mail at, such as my parents address?

Questions regarding rental income,0,"Hi reddit, I have a couple questions regarding the tax implication of rental income.

Background: I'm married. I'm in a higher income bracket than my wife. I was wondering what kind of potential tax benefits we can get based on our situation.

Question 1: my wife and I own a house that we live in as our principal residence. We each own 50% of the house. If we want to rent out the basement. Do we get to choose the % of rental income we can file as our income? I.e. can we declare the rental income as ""her"" income to benefit the tax saving? Same goes to the expenses such as the property tax and mortgage interest payment etc. Do we have any control over how to declare it? Or do we have to do 50-50?

Question 2: my wife owns a condo that she's rented out. We do not live in the condo. She owns 100% of the condo. She declares both the rental income and expenses in her tax return. I suppose we can't declare the rental expense in my tax return can we?

Both my questions are about the potential benefits of doing taxes as a married couple. I was just wondering if there is any in these scenarios? Or does it just seem like we're doing our taxes as two individuals even though we're married.

Thanks in advance Reddit.",2023-04-07 13:48:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12elxpq/questions_regarding_rental_income/
Where to file taxes for Quebec summer job?,1,"Hi :

My son ordinarily lives in NB (attending university in NB), but worked a summer job in Quebec last summer for about 2 months. Given that he was back residing in NB on Dec 31st and lived in Quebec less than half the year, does he only declare to the CRA as a resident on NB? More specifically, does anything need to be submitted to Revenue Quebec? He received a T4 and RL-1 for the summer job.

Many thanks!

Is line 14 on T4 net or gross?,0,"I’m wondering if its possible for me to avoid e.I clawback.   Correct me if I’m wrong but I’ve read you are exempt from the 30% clawback if your net income isn’t  excess of 75,375.  

My line 14 was 60,447
And UCCB / e.I benifit paid was 16,072
🟰 76,519

This makes me not exempt from the clawback when filing my income tax return. 

But I am curious because if line 14 is gross pay then wouldn’t I be exempt from the clawback?

Foreign property rented by parents,1,"Hello,
My wife has a property abroad. It was previously rented out to others and when doing the returns we filed the T1135 and declared the rental income and deductions. Now, her parents are living there and they pay the costs to live there ( mortgage, utilities, condo fee, etc.)

Foreign Tax Credit for stocks granted in US and vested in Canada,1,"Hello, I already submitted my tax return but going through some threads online, I think I did it incorrectly. So just want to double check here.  


Scenario:  
i used to work in the US and was granted stocks while I was there and have since moved back to Canada where the stocks are being vested.

My company reports the full amount of the vested stock on Canada payroll and taxes it at 35% in canada and 22% in US (this means i'll get a w2). On my W2, it also reports the full vested amount for the stocks.

When I filed my taxes, I included the income on the w2 as income on the foreign tax credit form (i believe box 43300). But I just realized if its already being reported on my Canadian payroll (t4), should I have used 0 for the foreign income?",2023-04-06 17:35:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12drmu6/foreign_tax_credit_for_stocks_granted_in_us_and/
Missed period to provide proof of CERB eligibility,0,"I had my CRA notifications connected to my parents email, they thought I was recieving the emails as well and didnt tell me I recieved a letter.

Apparently I had recieved a notice to provide proof of employment in 2021 for covid benefit eligibilty and had 45 days.

Now my 45 days have passed and I recieved notice that I am not elibible for CERB and owe 8000$. I have submitted my proof of employment now, but I am very stressed it is too late because I missed the 45 day period. I am a student and cannot at all afford to lose 8000$. I talked with an agent today and he told me to contact be in 6 weeks?!? If I have to pay it would drastically effect my plan for the next 6 weeks as I was planning on taking summer classes I would no longer afford.

Does anyone know if CRA has any lenience on late proof of eligibility? I am very confident I am eligible the concern is just that I missed the deadline.

Bit frustrated at this automated NOA system,0,"I made an innocent mistake while filing taxes for a family member two weeks ago . In one of the box 14s I put  a number ending in 267 instead of 627.

The individual still recieved the original refund a week after filing . Now I have to check the notice of reassessment and find out if he owes which he likely does .

&#x200B;

I know it is my fault and next year I will wait until everyone is at home and is able to connect with auto fill to avoid the inputting errors . My question is why doesn’t CRA double check against the slips they have on file and correct the returns if people make errors? Why do they just go with whatever people inputted and then months later ask people for money back if they got refunded more than what they were allowed?",2023-04-06 13:52:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12dl1hy/bit_frustrated_at_this_automated_noa_system/

Registering a Trust with the CRA,4,"You guys were very helpful with a previous question on the Trust for my Brother so maybe you can help with this too.

To be able to issue the necessary T3's, the Trust must be registered with the CRA.

I'm fine with everything except the Type of trust. The options are extensive to say the least.

This trust was created to contain the funds of my brothers inheritance from our parents. He is incapable of managing his own finances beyond the basics.

The only income to the Trust is from interest earnings from investments.

The types of Trusts can be found on the CRA website at [Trust Types](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/types-trusts.html)

The one that catches my eye is under  ""Inter vivos trusts""

Specifically: Deemed Resident Trust

Do you think this is the correct type or is there a better fit?

Calling the CRA at the moment is more than a little problematic.

&#x200B;

 Update: After talking with the CRA, you guys seem to have nailed it.

It's one of the following with 903 being the leader and 900 the backup. Not sure about 901 yet.

* **code 900**, Testamentary trust that is not identified by one of the other testamentary trust codes
* **code 901**, Lifetime Benefit trust
* **code 903**, Estate that designated itself as a graduated rate estate (applicable for tax years ending after 2015)",2023-04-05 20:05:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/12cw76m/registering_a_trust_with_the_cra/
Help with Non Resident Taxes,3,"Hi everybody, hoping someone can assist and/or give me some recommendations in terms of doing my taxes this year. 

I'm a Canadian PR holder who has not lived in Canada for the past few years. I continued to do some Canadian freelance work virtually after I had moved away, and have also sold some stocks I had still held onto. 

As I do not live there anymore, I am considered a ""non resident"" for tax purposes, which apparently is not supported by TurboTax. 

I've done the usual google search and messaged multiple firms and i've also reached out on websites such as upwork to try to find freelance tax consultants to assist with my return this year and have contacted +/- 20 entities with no response. As the tax deadline approaches i'm starting to get desperate (yes I know, I should have started far earlier but I did not think this would be such an issue).

I started to try to fill out my own forms (5013-RT1 for non residents) however it asks for T4 information input which my employer did not provide me, as I did not need it if I was not living in Canada (their words). 

I'm looking for some advice on how to proceed, and ideally any recommendations for tax consultants that are versed in non-resident matters.

"Family memeber hasn't filed taxes in 6 years, has no t4s he can track down",1,"He has called the CRA to mail him his previous few years of taxes so we can get them filed, but he ran into a bump when they asked his address. His address from 6 years ago was in the middle of nowhere (so google maps doesn't help), and he does not remember as he has moved almost every year since. They have told him to write a letter to the tax center (?) saying who he is and that he doesn't remember his last filed address. My question is what will this do? Will they respond with his address? Will they be the ones to send him his t4?
The CRA agent on the phone wasn't helpful at all, answered almost none of our questions, and to the ones he did answer, he was really hard to understand.

Any insight is appreciated as we don't know what the tax center (?) is or what will happen next.

also, yes, he knows he should've been filing his taxes. He wasn't trying to evade the government. If anything, they owe him a lump sum back.
